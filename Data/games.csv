Most who try end up face-down in a crater somewhere, not a thing to their name—barring the bullet in their back. You want to make it anywhere out there, you need more than just a dream: you need the right people at your back so that they can take the bullets for you. Between the Brotherhood, the Super Mutants, the Raiders and even those well-meaning few who think their way of living is the only right one, there’s plenty of competition for that cut of the world. So, you’d better be the best of the best, or else this place will chew you up and spit you right back out again.” Fallout: Factions is a skirmish-level wargame for two players, where you take control of a crew of Wastelanders vying for power in an irradiated hellscape, full to bursting with monsters, mercenaries, and murderous miscreants—all doing exactly the same. Over the course of several games, crews will rise and fall, each moving through their own stories thanks to an intricate Campaign system. On the tabletop, players control a unique group of miniatures, representing a core Faction from the Fallout universe, and bring them to battle the crews of other players in a fast-paced, dice-hurling, action-packed skirmish wargame—where every action can have long-lasting consequences. THIS BOOK CONTAINS all you need to know to take to the Wasteland, teaching you the rules of play, the in-depth Campaign system, and showcasing the iconic Factions of Fallout, helping you decide which flag to carry to battle. Combined with the Fallout: Factions “Battle for Nuka-World” Starter Set, or the Fallout: Factions Tokens and Terrain Pack, you’ll have everything needed to pick a Faction and start your journey to become the de-facto ruler of the Wasteland—as long as you don’t mind crushing a competitor or two along the way.",10.49,4.8,#1 Top Rated,101810,B00ABA0ZOA,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81yiXHwgQWL._AC_SL1500_.jpg

To play (as if you didnt already know), two to four players face each other, with the plastic mat in the center.

9d31da36-720e-493c-be67-b942bc87765b,Everdell Standard Edition by Starling Games - 1-4 Player Game Where You Build a Woodland City Full of Adorable Critters,"Dead of Winter: A Crossroads Game, the first game in this series, puts 2-5 players in a small, weakened colony of survivors in a world where most of humanity is either dead or diseased, flesh-craving monsters. Each player leads a faction of survivors with dozens of different characters in the game. Dead of Winter is a meta-cooperative psychological survival game. This means players are working together toward one common victory condition - but for each individual player to achieve victory, he must also complete his personal secret objective. This secret objective could relate to a psychological tick that's fairly harmless to most others in the colony, a dangerous obsession that could put the main objective at risk, a desire for sabotage of the main mission, or (worst of all) vengeance against the colony! Certain games could end with all players winning, some winning and some losing, or all players losing. Work toward the group's goal, but don't get walked all over by a loudmouth who's looking out only for his own interests! Dead of Winter is an experience that can be accomplished only through the medium of tabletop games. It's a story-centric game about surviving through a harsh winter in an apocalyptic world. The survivors are all dealing with their own psychological imperatives, but must still find a way to work together to fight off outside threats, resolve crises, find food and supplies and keep the colony's morale up. Dead of Winter has players making frequent, difficult, heavily- thematic, wildly-varying decisions that often have them deciding between what is best for the colony and what is best for themselves.",0.0,4.8,200+ bought in past month,406,B09ZWQTTNR,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81SgtLjS4RL._AC_SL1500_.jpg

STAR CARDS can be ""converted"" for a short moment into any number card that is in the same column or row as it is. Star cards thus help to collect triplets and quadruplets that have been reached and can be discarded with all their points.

The Legend of the Archeans This game is centered on the legend of the Archean empire, a civilization that possessed the ability to control the Earth's core elements--fire, wind, water, and earth--through four sacred treasures. These treasures stayed hidden from enemies for years on the Forbidden Island, which was designed to sink if intruders ever attempted to capture them. Set the appropriate water level for your gaming skill, and let the adventures begin! Capture the Four Sacred Treasures Before the Island Sinks! Your team of adventurers must work together to keep the Forbidden Island from sinking as you seek the four treasures hidden within. The mission is carried out using different combinations of Flood, Treasure, and Adventurer Cards on the 24 tiles that make up the Forbidden Island. Once you've captured each treasure using the appropriate cards, you must make it to Fools' Landing and escape by helicopter in order to win. If the island sinks before you complete your tasks, the mission ends in defeat. Use Collaborative Play to Succeed Each player is dealt an Adventure Card and given a corresponding pawn before the game starts, designating him or her with a certain set of strengths. This game is designed so that instead of competing with other players, you work to find the treasures and find out how to best use each Adventurer's strengths through collaborative play. This stimulates problem-solving and strategy skills.

The Bluecoat army is weary and has been significantly weakened, but his men will not surrender. Are you ready to help the Lieutenant defeat the Redcoat army? The Bluecoats are counting on a brilliant strategist like you.
The aim of this classic board game is to capture the enemy’s flag while defending your own. Luckily, you are not alone; you have an entire army at your disposal, along with a seductive spy and six deadly bombs.
Place the screen in the center of the game board. Secretly deploy your army by placing the 40 playing pieces on the first four rows of the game board. Red begins. Remove the screen once both players are ready, but beware, there is no luck in this game, and how you place your pieces on the board can determine whether you win or lose.
Taking turns, each player must either move one of their own playing pieces or attack one of their enemy’s playing pieces. The piece that holds the lowest rank loses and is removed from the board. However, your elusive Spy is an exception to this rule, so use their skills wisely.
What tactics will you choose? Master Stratego Original combines stealth, long-range planning, bluffs, and double bluffs to outthink your opponent and emerge victorious. First, however, you must act decisively and be confident in your strategy because if you made a move and have let go of your piece, you can’t retract the move.",21.99,4.8,1K+ bought in past month,4160,B01C3IMJNC,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61DleiIh-GL._AC_SL1500_.jpg

You see, the King loves castles, having built Neuschwanstein (the castle that inspired the Disney theme park castles) and others, but now he's commissioned you to build the biggest, bestest castle ever — subject, of course, to his ever-changing whims. Each player acts as a building contractor who is adding rooms to the castle they're building while also selling their services to other players. In the game, each player starts with a simple foyer. One player takes on the role of the Master Builder, and that player sets prices for a set of rooms that can be purchased by the other players. The Master Builder will then pick from the leftovers after the other players have paid the Master Builder for their rooms. When a room is added to a castle, the player who built it gains castle points based on the size and type of room constructed, as well as bonus points based on the location of the room. When a room is completed, with all entrance ways leading to other rooms in the castle, the player receives one of seven special rewards. After each purchasing round, a new player becomes the Master Builder who sets prices for a new set of rooms. After several rounds, the game ends, then additional points are awarded for achieving bonus goals, having the most popular rooms, and being the most accommodating to the King's demands, which change each game.

Risk for 2 Players adds a neutral army to the mix, and Capital Risk is a shorter variation of the classic game. No matter which variation you play, rememberwhen it comes to taking over the world, it's all about who is willing to take the biggest Risk.

In their roles as hunters, collectors, farmers, and tool makers, our ancestors worked with their legs and backs straining against wooden plows in the stony earth. Of course, progress did not stop with the wooden plow. People always searched for better tools and more productive plants to make their work more effective. In Stone Age, the players live in this time, just as our ancestors did. They collect wood, break stone and wash their gold from the river. They trade freely, expand their village and so achieve new levels of civilization. With a balance of luck and planning, the players compete for food in this pre-historic time. Players use up to ten tribe members each in three phases. In the first phase, players place their men in regions of the board that they think will benefit them, including the hunt, the trading center, or the quarry. In the second phase, the starting player activates each of their staffed areas in whatever sequence they choose, followed in turn by the other players. In the third phase, players must have enough food available to feed their populations, or they face losing resources or points. From the Manufacturer The Dawn of Mankind. Our ancestors were hard workers, resting only very little. Luckily for us, their ingenuity allowed them to make their work easier, day after day. In Stone Age, players are sent back to that arduous period of history. With tools, quite archaic at first, you will be able to collect wood, stone and gold. These resources will allow you to attain higher levels of knowledge and build sturdier roofs over your head. Though luck plays an im­portant part in the game, only those who master their fate will be able to grasp victory. Finally, one mustn't forget to feed their tribe as that would represent a major setback for them. Relive history.

6dad975a-d4eb-4931-ad59-4a44c51eb63e,"Monopoly Junior Board Game for 4 players, Ages 5 and up (Amazon Exclusive)","Brass: Birmingham is an economic strategy game sequel to Martin Wallace' 2007 masterpiece, Brass. Birmingham tells the story of competing entrepreneurs in Birmingham during the industrial revolution, between the years of 1770-1870. As in its predecessor, you must develop, build, and establish your industries and network, in an effort to exploit low or high market demands. Each round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following actions (found in the original game): 1) Build - Pay required resources and place an industry tile. 2) Network - Add a rail / canal link, expanding your network. 3) Develop - Increase the VP value of an industry. 4) Sell - Sell your cotton, manufactured goods and pottery. 5) Loan - Take a £30 loan and reduce your income. Brass: Birmingham also features a new sixth action: 6) Scout - Discard three cards and take a wild location and wild industry card. (This action replaces Double Action Build in original Brass.) The game is played over two halves: the canal era (years 1770-1830) and the rail era (years 1830-1870). To win the game, score the most VPs. VPs are counted at the end of each half for the canals, rails and established (flipped) industry tiles. Birmingham features dynamic scoring canals/rails. Instead of each flipped industry tile giving a static 1 VP to all connected canals and rails, many industries give 0 or even 2 VPs. This provides players with the opportunity to score much higher value canals in the first era, and creates interesting strategy with industry placement. Iron, coal, and cotton are three industries which appear in both the original Brass as well as in Brass: Birmingham. New ""Sell"" system Brewing has become a fundamental part of the culture in Birmingham. You must now sell your product through traders located around the edges of the board. Each of these traders is looking for a specific type of good each game. To sell cotton, pottery, or manufactured goods to these traders, you must also ""grease the wheels of industry"" by consuming beer. For example, a level 1 cotton mill requires one beer to flip. As an incentive to sell early, the first player to sell to a trader receives free beer. Birmingham features three all-new industry types: Brewery - Produces precious beer barrels required to sell goods. Manufactured goods - Function like cotton, but features eight levels. Each level of manufactured goods provides unique rewards, rather than just escalating in VPs, making it a more versatile (yet potentially more difficult) path vs cotton. Pottery - These behemoths of Birmingham offer huge VPs, but at a huge cost and need to plan. Increased Coal and Iron Market size - The price of coal and iron can now go up to £8 per cube, and it's not uncommon. Brass: Birmingham is a finely brewed sequel to one of history's most industrial economic games. It offers a very different story arc and experience from its predecessor. Many of the tried and true strategies of the original are no longer as powerful as they once were, and other interesting new strategies are waiting for you to discover.",16.99,4.8,1K+ bought in past month,12008,B06XYLL66Y,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91t8h7FrSqL._AC_SL1500_.jpg

a4cc862a-844a-476c-bffd-79a29a3dd105,Hasbro Gaming The Game of Life Board Game (Amazon Exclusive),"Product Description The ""Stone Age"" times were hard indeed. In their roles as hunters, collectors, farmers, and tool makers, our ancestors worked with their legs and backs straining against wooden plows in the stony earth. Of course, progress did not stop with the wooden plow. People always searched for better tools and more productive plants to make their work more effective. In Stone Age, the players live in this time, just as our ancestors did. They collect wood, break stone and wash their gold from the river. They trade freely, expand their village and so achieve new levels of civilization. With a balance of luck and planning, the players compete for food in this pre-historic time. Players use up to ten tribe members each in three phases. In the first phase, players place their men in regions of the board that they think will benefit them, including the hunt, the trading center, or the quarry. In the second phase, the starting player activates each of their staffed areas in whatever sequence they choose, followed in turn by the other players. In the third phase, players must have enough food available to feed their populations, or they face losing resources or points. From the Manufacturer The Dawn of Mankind. Our ancestors were hard workers, resting only very little. Luckily for us, their ingenuity allowed them to make their work easier, day after day. In Stone Age, players are sent back to that arduous period of history. With tools, quite archaic at first, you will be able to collect wood, stone and gold. These resources will allow you to attain higher levels of knowledge and build sturdier roofs over your head. Though luck plays an im­portant part in the game, only those who master their fate will be able to grasp victory. Finally, one mustn't forget to feed their tribe as that would represent a major setback for them. Relive history.

Birmingham tells the story of competing entrepreneurs in Birmingham during the industrial revolution, between the years of 1770-1870. As in its predecessor, you must develop, build, and establish your industries and network, in an effort to exploit low or high market demands. Each round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following actions (found in the original game): 1) Build - Pay required resources and place an industry tile. 2) Network - Add a rail / canal link, expanding your network. 3) Develop - Increase the VP value of an industry. 4) Sell - Sell your cotton, manufactured goods and pottery. 5) Loan - Take a £30 loan and reduce your income. Brass: Birmingham also features a new sixth action: 6) Scout - Discard three cards and take a wild location and wild industry card. (This action replaces Double Action Build in original Brass.) The game is played over two halves: the canal era (years 1770-1830) and the rail era (years 1830-1870). To win the game, score the most VPs. VPs are counted at the end of each half for the canals, rails and established (flipped) industry tiles. Birmingham features dynamic scoring canals/rails. Instead of each flipped industry tile giving a static 1 VP to all connected canals and rails, many industries give 0 or even 2 VPs. This provides players with the opportunity to score much higher value canals in the first era, and creates interesting strategy with industry placement. Iron, coal, and cotton are three industries which appear in both the original Brass as well as in Brass: Birmingham. New ""Sell"" system Brewing has become a fundamental part of the culture in Birmingham. You must now sell your product through traders located around the edges of the board. Each of these traders is looking for a specific type of good each game. To sell cotton, pottery, or manufactured goods to these traders, you must also ""grease the wheels of industry"" by consuming beer. For example, a level 1 cotton mill requires one beer to flip. As an incentive to sell early, the first player to sell to a trader receives free beer.

It's time to create your island: a 4x4 tableau of self-supporting growth, expansion and supply where even the cards you don't need become compost for future gain. OVERVIEW: Earth is an open-world engine builder for 1 to 5 players with simple rules and countless strategic possibilities. With its encyclopedic nature and a near-infinite number of tableau combinations, every single game will allow you to discover new synergies and connections, just as our vast and fascinating world allows us to do! Players will create a self-supporting engine of growth, expansion, and supply by drafting from a deck of over 364 unique cards and strategically placing them in their tableau. STARTING THE GAME - The game begins before the starting hand has even been drafted. Players will receive an Island, Climate, and Ecosystem card during set-up. Using these double-sided cards, each player sows their strategy by selecting one side of the card to place face-up in their play area. The combination of these three cards introduces asymmetry to the game by providing variable starting resources, bonus abilities, and unique end-game scoring objectives. ON YOUR TURN - On their turn, the active player will choose one of four different actions, reaping their major benefits, while all other players welcome the minor benefit. Subsequently, all players activate any cards on their player-board, and in their tableau, which match the color of the chosen action. Players continue taking actions, arranging their Island, sowing Plants and developing Terrains to attract elusive Fauna, and unlock the scoring bonuses of diverse Ecosystems. TRIGGERING END GAME - Once a player has added a sixteenth card to their 4×4 tableau, they earn a completion bonus and trigger the end of the game. All players will tally the victory points they earned from completing Ecosystems, reaching Fauna objectives, Composting cards, gaining Plant cubes and Growth pieces, for their Plant and Terrain values and for Events played.

Average | Quick-Playing Travel Games | Fun Summer Activities | Vacation Essentials | Ages 7+","Hog it all to win! The Piggy Piggy game is a fast-paced family card game that’s as easy as it is fun! Players take turns playing food cards from their hand to try to steal pigs and score the most points. Each player starts with 5 cards, including colored food cards, such as tacos (yellow) and ice cream (pink). On their turn, a player plays all the cards they have from one type of food by placing it in a stack. If their stack has the most food, then they earn the same-colored pig figure—or can steal it from another player! Have a goat card? Use it to sabotage an opponent by discarding a food card from their stack and maybe forcing them to give up their pig! When a player redraws cards at the end of their turn, if they have any pigs, they’ll score a point for each drawn card that matches their pig’s color. Score 8 points first to win! The Piggy Piggy game is a fantastic choice for those looking for fun card games for kids and adults.

The Pass The Pigs classic party game consists of two pigs - which you use as dice- a pad, two pencils and a carrying case. Roll the pigs as many times as you dare on your turn to score points. Just don't role a ""Pig Out"" or an ""Oinker."" For example, if both pigs land on all fours, that's called a ""Double Trotter"" and you'll earn 20 points. Other classic scoring rolls include standard (single) Trotters, Razorbacks (standard and double), the famous Leaning Jowler, and more! The first person to 100 points wins. Makes an ideal travel game with its small plastic carrying case. Amazon.com How's your tolerance for puns? You'll need some for Pass the Pigs, a simple game of chance built around a pig theme. Instead of dice, you roll two cute pink piglets, and you gain or lose points depending on how the critters land. For example, if both land on all fours, called a ""double trotter,"" you get 20 points; if they land lying opposite each other, called a ""Pig Out,"" you gain no points and cede your turn. There are a number of other rules as well as a variation called ""Hog Call."" This would be a good travel game (the pigs, instructions, and scoring pad fit in a small, tidy box) or a fine present for someone who's, well, into pigs! --Elisa Murray P.when('A').execute(function(A) { A.on('a:expander:toggle_description:toggle:collapse', function(data) { window.scroll(0, data.expander.$expander[0].offsetTop-100); }); }); From the Manufacturer Classic party game for over 25 years, now completely redesigned with a cool new carrying case.

They learn ways to remember their cards and strategies to figure out what cards other players might have. They also begin to develop an intuitive sense of probability. Rat-a-tat Cat requires skill, strategy, and awareness, challenging both young children and adults. Amazon.com It's never too early to develop a good poker face. With Rat-a-Tat Cat , a poker face is just one of the skills players need to perfect. As in poker, luck, skill, strategy, and intuition each play a part. Players are dealt four cards, which are kept face- down, except for a quick peek at two of them. Each player in turn pulls a card from the draw pile to replace one of the four. Memory is important, as the object is to end with the lowest score, and players must keep track of the values on their four cards. ""Peek,"" ""Swap,"" and ""Draw Two"" Power cards turn up occasionally, allowing players to maneuver and strategize further. Delightfully witty pictures of cats (the good guys--low points) and rats (bad guys--high points) illustrate each of the 54 cards. Young card sharks will develop a sense of timing and greater ease with numbers, and can begin to grasp the concept of probability.

Birmingham tells the story of competing entrepreneurs in Birmingham during the industrial revolution, between the years of 1770-1870. As in its predecessor, you must develop, build, and establish your industries and network, in an effort to exploit low or high market demands. Each round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following actions (found in the original game): 1) Build - Pay required resources and place an industry tile. 2) Network - Add a rail / canal link, expanding your network. 3) Develop - Increase the VP value of an industry. 4) Sell - Sell your cotton, manufactured goods and pottery. 5) Loan - Take a £30 loan and reduce your income. Brass: Birmingham also features a new sixth action: 6) Scout - Discard three cards and take a wild location and wild industry card. (This action replaces Double Action Build in original Brass.) The game is played over two halves: the canal era (years 1770-1830) and the rail era (years 1830-1870). To win the game, score the most VPs. VPs are counted at the end of each half for the canals, rails and established (flipped) industry tiles. Birmingham features dynamic scoring canals/rails. Instead of each flipped industry tile giving a static 1 VP to all connected canals and rails, many industries give 0 or even 2 VPs. This provides players with the opportunity to score much higher value canals in the first era, and creates interesting strategy with industry placement. Iron, coal, and cotton are three industries which appear in both the original Brass as well as in Brass: Birmingham. New ""Sell"" system Brewing has become a fundamental part of the culture in Birmingham. You must now sell your product through traders located around the edges of the board. Each of these traders is looking for a specific type of good each game. To sell cotton, pottery, or manufactured goods to these traders, you must also ""grease the wheels of industry"" by consuming beer. For example, a level 1 cotton mill requires one beer to flip. As an incentive to sell early, the first player to sell to a trader receives free beer. Birmingham features three all-new industry types: Brewery - Produces precious beer barrels required to sell goods. Manufactured goods - Function like cotton, but features eight levels. Each level of manufactured goods provides unique rewards, rather than just escalating in VPs, making it a more versatile (yet potentially more difficult) path vs cotton. Pottery - These behemoths of Birmingham offer huge VPs, but at a huge cost and need to plan. Increased Coal and Iron Market size - The price of coal and iron can now go up to £8 per cube, and it's not uncommon. Brass: Birmingham is a finely brewed sequel to one of history's most industrial economic games. It offers a very different story arc and experience from its predecessor. Many of the tried and true strategies of the original are no longer as powerful as they once were, and other interesting new strategies are waiting for you to discover.",44.99,4.7,300+ bought in past month,71,B0BZ9NJKQB,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81aB72ceITL._AC_SL1500_.jpg

Stomp on some fire ants, shriek at a grumpy troll, or strike the menacing orange dragon with a magical silver sword. Choose your strategy carefully because the landscape of Dragonwood is ever-changing. Only the bravest will overcome the odds to emerge victorious! It may be hard to imagine, but Dragonwood, with its vast array of richly illustrated cards, started out looking much different than where it ended. Inventor Darren Kisgen submitted a prototype without a single illustration - just simple words and numbers written in marker on blank white cards. Well apparently that's all was needed, because within moments, our play testers were enraptured with the simple-to-learn but deeply engaging fantasy-themed game.

They thought that there had to be a better way!
A foldable board was the answer.
We spend a lot of time talking to other tabletop RPG players. This provides us with ideas for new products.
Our products are unique and innovative. We enjoy trying new ideas and fine-tuning them.
Products get copied so we have to keep innovating.
We recommend correctable pens for long-lasting outlines and dry-erase markers for short-term drawings. The dry-erase markers can easily be erased with fingers or pieces of cloth, erasing the correctables requires the use of the erasing tip.
The use of a damp cloth or micro cloth is required for most markings after a couple of days (a little rubbing alcohol can help too), this also helps against smudging. No pens or markers are included.
​The classic board is foldable and measures 13.5'' x 11.5''x 0.4'' fully folded. The classic box measures 13.75'' x 11.75'' x 1.75'' and can easily fit in a backpack. This leaves some empty space in the provided box that can be filled with dice, miniatures, map tiles, rulebooks, sheets, and markers.
The drawings can be left on the board when folding. This is convenient for multiple gaming sessions requiring the same terrain.
The XL board and box are slightly bigger: the board is 17''x11''x0.75'' fully folded and the box is 17.25''x11.25''x 2''.
The boxes are compatible with Hexers GM Screen. It fits in the box next to the board.
NOT INCLUDED: Backpack, Hexers GM Screen, Markers, Dice, Rulebooks
Your party has just entered a fearsome dungeon looking to complete its quest. Your DM pulls out his Hexers RPG board: he is well-prepared as always. On his board you see the outlines of the dungeon drawn in black correctable ink, the details are filled out with the dry erasable variant in many different colors.
He confidently gets the miniatures out of this mysterious red box: it seems as if it is related to the board. Your party is surprised! You are used to him rolling out vinyl maps.
But somehow you do not mind, the board seems strangely familiar yet novel and intriguing. Your DM lets go a smile: ""I recently bought this board. It just seemed awesome and very practical. I wanted to try something new!"". Your party fully heartedly agrees: ""Yes it looks quite fancy!"". You all slowly look back to the game, the freshly placed monsters and everyone rolls for initiative.

Great creatures known as Beasts emerged, determined to protect their land. One player will take on the role of the Beast, while the other players work together as skilled hunters. The Beast uses a deck of direction cards to move over forests, swamps, and caverns, using guile and deceit to hide its tracks from the hunters. Hunters have one chance to search each round, making it a tense decision as they follow the trail. Each action is performed by playing up to two cards per turn. Before each round players will draft for the most important cards. All action cards can be used by both the Beast and hunters alike. Hunters will need to cooperate and strategize to defeat the Beast and the Beast will need to skillfully outmaneuver the crafty hunters to reclaim their territory.

7670ced2-6d75-4d28-abb3-8b72d535647d,Beast - Board Game,"Long Dog Games is an employee-owned small business based in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Their mission is to share their love of games with the world by creating fun, unique gaming experiences. Their debut game, Pericle: Gathering Darkness, was funded by dedicated Kickstarter backers and strives to bridge a gap between the old and new generations of gamers by combining traditional tabletop roleplaying with sleek, app-guided gameplay.
No Game Master or preparation required! A computer or tablet sits at the table so that Loremaster can serve the role of Game Master. This game is perfect for when your usual RPG group isn't available, or when you wish to set off on an adventure by yourself.
Experience the world of Pericle through Loremaster, which presents the Gathering Darkness campaign through rich narratives, animated cutscenes, breathtaking art, and an original soundtrack.
The world is rich with history, culture, factions, politics, religions and NPCs. Most importantly, Loremaster’s branching storylines change according to player choice; your decisions shape the world of Pericle!
Pericle: Gathering Darkness has a classless creation system that allows players to build their own unique characters with varying weapon proficiencies, skills, and magic abilities. Players can even change heroes or builds mid-campaign if they wish!
The hero creation system is complex and detailed, so for players who wish to learn the game before building their own, 5 pre-generated heroes are included in the core game for beginners.
Gathering Darkness is the first of many Pericle campaigns. It can take as little as 1 hour to play each session if desired, or players can continue until they wish to end. Loremaster saves the progress, so you can pick up right where you left off!
We estimate that it takes more than 60 hours of gameplay to finish the Gathering Darkness campaign. Players can choose to create more than one party and make different decisions to influence the story on each new play-through!
Pericle: Gathering Darkness standees are made of strong acrylic and have removable bases. Each hero standee features unique, double-sided artwork. Standees are covered in a thin plastic film to protect the artwork while shipping, which can be removed on arrival.
Pericle: Gathering Darkness core game contains 25 double-sided, full color chipboard maps. Each of the unique battle maps featured in the Gathering Darkness campaign are the creation of Eric Henson, The Modern Lich. Eric has created maps and assets for use with D&D, Pathfinder, and other tabletop RPGs, and his talents help bring the vibrancy and danger of Pericle to life in the maps!
Each map is numbered for ease of use. When it's time to set up the tabletop for battle, Loremaster will indicate which map to take out and where to place enemy and hero standees. Hazards on the map, such as water or lava, are explained in the combat setup. These vibrant maps set the scene on the tabletop and create a backdrop for the battle.
The Pericle: Gathering Darkness story unfolds inside Loremaster, our companion app. Loremaster presents everything to players, from soundtrack to cutscenes. Most importantly, Loremaster relays story arcs and decisions for your group of heroes to make.
​
Pericle: Gathering Darkness isn't just about combat; mystery, political intrigue, and exploration all await you from the moment you set foot in the Jarin Isles. But along the way, you're bound to come into conflict with a host of enemies. When combat is inevitable, Loremaster will bring up the combat screen.
Setup for combat is quick and simple! Loremaster will tell you which map to use, where to place enemies, and where you can place your own heroes - and then it's time for the battle to begin. Dice are rolled, standees moved, spells cast, and attacks made. Players move through initiative, movement, and action rounds until the combat is resolved. The result is entered in to Loremaster, and then the adventure continues.
Pericle: Gathering Darkness is a bold new tabletop RPG that combines a fantasy RPG world with a ground-breaking web-based app called Loremaster. App-driven gameplay presents the campaign, which takes away the need for a Game Master, and offers branching storylines so that player decisions impact and change the world around them. Dice-based combat and important story decisions anchor Pericle: Gathering Darkness in the realm of classic RPG gaming, while streamlined mechanics and a classless hero creation system give players the freedom to engage in tactical combat using totally unique characters. The world of Pericle awaits!

You want to make it anywhere out there, you need more than just a dream: you need the right people at your back so that they can take the bullets for you. Between the Brotherhood, the Super Mutants, the Raiders and even those well-meaning few who think their way of living is the only right one, there’s plenty of competition for that cut of the world. So, you’d better be the best of the best, or else this place will chew you up and spit you right back out again.” Fallout: Factions is a skirmish-level wargame for two players, where you take control of a crew of Wastelanders vying for power in an irradiated hellscape, full to bursting with monsters, mercenaries, and murderous miscreants—all doing exactly the same. Over the course of several games, crews will rise and fall, each moving through their own stories thanks to an intricate Campaign system. On the tabletop, players control a unique group of miniatures, representing a core Faction from the Fallout universe, and bring them to battle the crews of other players in a fast-paced, dice-hurling, action-packed skirmish wargame—where every action can have long-lasting consequences.

Martin's fantasy novels. View larger. Claim the Iron Throne Based on the bestselling fantasy novels by George R.R. Martin (now a hit HBO series), A Game of Thrones: The Board Game draws players into a war-torn world of sun-scorched sands, lush forests, and chilling northlands. Each player takes control of one of six Great Houses of Westeros, then sets out on an epic campaign of combat and politics to secure total dominance. This board game includes clear, detailed rules to guide you through setup and gameplay. Play begins when each person receives an army of footmen, knights, siege engines and ship units as well as a set of order tokens and other necessary components. Each player also receives a deck of unique house cards, which represent important characters from A Song of Ice and Fire and are used as leaders in battles against rival houses. Vibrant Art and Intricate Detailing A Game of Thrones: The Board Game captures the most memorable elements of George R.R. Martin's popular series. The detailed board represents an accurate map of Westeros, and the tokens and cards convey many of its most significant locations and characters. Attractive marbled plastic figures shaped as footmen, knights, ships, and siege engines display your military might to the realm while contributing to the game's overall medieval aesthetic. Game board is enhanced with figures, battle cards, tokens, and overlays. Raise Your House to Dominance Game play proceeds over the course of ten rounds, after which the player who has claimed the most areas containing castles or strongholds is declared the winner. If at any time throughout the game a player controls seven such areas, that player may immediately claim victory. Each round in the game is made up of three phases: the Westeros Phase, the Planning Phase, and the Action Phase. The Westeros Phase represents special events and the day-to-day activities in Westeros. In the Planning Phase, players secretly assign orders to all of their units. This portion of the game emphasizes diplomacy and deduction. Can players trust their so-called allies, or is a timely betrayal in the making? Finally, during the Action Phase, orders are revealed, alliances crumble, and fierce battles decide the players' fates. House cards include characters from A Song of Ice and Fire. View larger. Detailed player screens conceal your strategic planning. View larger. A World of Intrigue, Diplomacy, and Warfare Fragile alliances will form and break over the course of each game, as players promise support to neighboring Houses only to betray them for their own selfish ends. But beware; as the war unfolds, the barbaric Wildings (which are controlled automatically by the game) work to amass their forces in the far north. Players must occasionally set aside their differences to face a common foe--or face the consequences together. A Game of Thrones: The Board Game draws you into a vibrant gaming world, bringing your favorite characters to life. The board resembles paint on distressed parchment for an old-world look, while the token and card art exhibits intricate detailing fans of the novels will recognize and enjoy.

Martin's fantasy novels. View larger. Claim the Iron Throne Based on the bestselling fantasy novels by George R.R. Martin (now a hit HBO series), A Game of Thrones: The Board Game draws players into a war-torn world of sun-scorched sands, lush forests, and chilling northlands. Each player takes control of one of six Great Houses of Westeros, then sets out on an epic campaign of combat and politics to secure total dominance. This board game includes clear, detailed rules to guide you through setup and gameplay. Play begins when each person receives an army of footmen, knights, siege engines and ship units as well as a set of order tokens and other necessary components. Each player also receives a deck of unique house cards, which represent important characters from A Song of Ice and Fire and are used as leaders in battles against rival houses. Vibrant Art and Intricate Detailing A Game of Thrones: The Board Game captures the most memorable elements of George R.R. Martin's popular series. The detailed board represents an accurate map of Westeros, and the tokens and cards convey many of its most significant locations and characters. Attractive marbled plastic figures shaped as footmen, knights, ships, and siege engines display your military might to the realm while contributing to the game's overall medieval aesthetic. Game board is enhanced with figures, battle cards, tokens, and overlays. Raise Your House to Dominance Game play proceeds over the course of ten rounds, after which the player who has claimed the most areas containing castles or strongholds is declared the winner. If at any time throughout the game a player controls seven such areas, that player may immediately claim victory. Each round in the game is made up of three phases: the Westeros Phase, the Planning Phase, and the Action Phase. The Westeros Phase represents special events and the day-to-day activities in Westeros. In the Planning Phase, players secretly assign orders to all of their units. This portion of the game emphasizes diplomacy and deduction. Can players trust their so-called allies, or is a timely betrayal in the making? Finally, during the Action Phase, orders are revealed, alliances crumble, and fierce battles decide the players' fates. House cards include characters from A Song of Ice and Fire. View larger. Detailed player screens conceal your strategic planning. View larger. A World of Intrigue, Diplomacy, and Warfare Fragile alliances will form and break over the course of each game, as players promise support to neighboring Houses only to betray them for their own selfish ends. But beware; as the war unfolds, the barbaric Wildings (which are controlled automatically by the game) work to amass their forces in the far north. Players must occasionally set aside their differences to face a common foe--or face the consequences together. A Game of Thrones: The Board Game draws you into a vibrant gaming world, bringing your favorite characters to life.

In their roles as hunters, collectors, farmers, and tool makers, our ancestors worked with their legs and backs straining against wooden plows in the stony earth. Of course, progress did not stop with the wooden plow. People always searched for better tools and more productive plants to make their work more effective. In Stone Age, the players live in this time, just as our ancestors did. They collect wood, break stone and wash their gold from the river. They trade freely, expand their village and so achieve new levels of civilization. With a balance of luck and planning, the players compete for food in this pre-historic time. Players use up to ten tribe members each in three phases. In the first phase, players place their men in regions of the board that they think will benefit them, including the hunt, the trading center, or the quarry. In the second phase, the starting player activates each of their staffed areas in whatever sequence they choose, followed in turn by the other players. In the third phase, players must have enough food available to feed their populations, or they face losing resources or points. From the Manufacturer The Dawn of Mankind. Our ancestors were hard workers, resting only very little. Luckily for us, their ingenuity allowed them to make their work easier, day after day. In Stone Age, players are sent back to that arduous period of history. With tools, quite archaic at first, you will be able to collect wood, stone and gold. These resources will allow you to attain higher levels of knowledge and build sturdier roofs over your head. Though luck plays an im­portant part in the game, only those who master their fate will be able to grasp victory. Finally, one mustn't forget to feed their tribe as that would represent a major setback for them. Relive history.

A dazzling progression - A game of Little Factory starts with a few coins, which players can exchange for their first resources. These are arranged in 3 levels, more and more complex to obtain. The goal is to progress as quickly as possible through the resources of different levels in order to be able to build buildings, which will make your job easier, in addition to earning you valuable victory points. The first player to reach 10 points immediately wins the game. Players increase their assets by processing resources into other resources, such as turning wood into wood or charcoal, or turning charcoal and flour into bread. If you increase your assets, you can build a building and use that building to acquire resources and victory points more quickly. The more buildings players construct, the more actions that become available on future turns. On a turn, players take one of two actions: Production: Choose a resource card or building card in the production action area, and gain the item shown on it; or, Trade: Discard resource cards from your hand to acquire resource or building cards of the same value or less from the available cards. In addition, players can use the effects of each building they own once per turn (including on the turn during which they were acquired). An example of a building effect is: exchanging a thread card in hand for cloth available in the play area. Chain together cards, buildings, and actions to create more victory points.

Birmingham tells the story of competing entrepreneurs in Birmingham during the industrial revolution, between the years of 1770-1870. As in its predecessor, you must develop, build, and establish your industries and network, in an effort to exploit low or high market demands. Each round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following actions (found in the original game): 1) Build - Pay required resources and place an industry tile. 2) Network - Add a rail / canal link, expanding your network. 3) Develop - Increase the VP value of an industry. 4) Sell - Sell your cotton, manufactured goods and pottery. 5) Loan - Take a £30 loan and reduce your income. Brass: Birmingham also features a new sixth action: 6) Scout - Discard three cards and take a wild location and wild industry card. (This action replaces Double Action Build in original Brass.) The game is played over two halves: the canal era (years 1770-1830) and the rail era (years 1830-1870). To win the game, score the most VPs. VPs are counted at the end of each half for the canals, rails and established (flipped) industry tiles. Birmingham features dynamic scoring canals/rails. Instead of each flipped industry tile giving a static 1 VP to all connected canals and rails, many industries give 0 or even 2 VPs. This provides players with the opportunity to score much higher value canals in the first era, and creates interesting strategy with industry placement. Iron, coal, and cotton are three industries which appear in both the original Brass as well as in Brass: Birmingham. New ""Sell"" system Brewing has become a fundamental part of the culture in Birmingham. You must now sell your product through traders located around the edges of the board. Each of these traders is looking for a specific type of good each game. To sell cotton, pottery, or manufactured goods to these traders, you must also ""grease the wheels of industry"" by consuming beer. For example, a level 1 cotton mill requires one beer to flip. As an incentive to sell early, the first player to sell to a trader receives free beer. Birmingham features three all-new industry types: Brewery - Produces precious beer barrels required to sell goods. Manufactured goods - Function like cotton, but features eight levels. Each level of manufactured goods provides unique rewards, rather than just escalating in VPs, making it a more versatile (yet potentially more difficult) path vs cotton. Pottery - These behemoths of Birmingham offer huge VPs, but at a huge cost and need to plan. Increased Coal and Iron Market size - The price of coal and iron can now go up to £8 per cube, and it's not uncommon. Brass: Birmingham is a finely brewed sequel to one of history's most industrial economic games. It offers a very different story arc and experience from its predecessor. Many of the tried and true strategies of the original are no longer as powerful as they once were, and other interesting new strategies are waiting for you to discover.",0.0,0.0,0,0,B0D6BDGBXC,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/714P9qEhfRL._AC_SL1500_.jpg

Micro Dojo is a 20 min tactical euro game for two players, intended to fit comfortably in a pocket or purse. In Micro Dojo, players take control of the Ninja, Samurai, Sumo and Geisha meeples to generate resources, develop the town, and score points by achieving the Shogun’s tasks.

You can't move the last meeple either you or your opponent moved. The games end when the last objective is triggered, or a player reaches 7 points.

You see, the King loves castles, having built Neuschwanstein (the castle that inspired the Disney theme park castles) and others, but now he's commissioned you to build the biggest, bestest castle ever — subject, of course, to his ever-changing whims. Each player acts as a building contractor who is adding rooms to the castle they're building while also selling their services to other players. In the game, each player starts with a simple foyer. One player takes on the role of the Master Builder, and that player sets prices for a set of rooms that can be purchased by the other players. The Master Builder will then pick from the leftovers after the other players have paid the Master Builder for their rooms. When a room is added to a castle, the player who built it gains castle points based on the size and type of room constructed, as well as bonus points based on the location of the room. When a room is completed, with all entrance ways leading to other rooms in the castle, the player receives one of seven special rewards. After each purchasing round, a new player becomes the Master Builder who sets prices for a new set of rooms. After several rounds, the game ends, then additional points are awarded for achieving bonus goals, having the most popular rooms, and being the most accommodating to the King's demands, which change each game.

In bestsellers such as Purple Cow and Tribes
, Seth Godin taught readers how to make remarkable products and spread powerful ideas. But this book is different. It's about you - your choices, your future, and your potential to make a huge difference in whatever field you choose. There used to be two teams in every workplace: management and labor. Now there's a third team, the linchpins. These people invent, lead (regardless of title), connect others, make things happen, and create order out of chaos. They figure out what to do when there's no rule book. They delight and challenge their customers and peers. They love their work, pour their best selves into it, and turn each day into a kind of art. Linchpins are the essential building blocks of great organizations. Like the small piece of hardware that keeps a wheel from falling off its axle, they may not be famous but they're indispensable. And in today's world, they get the best jobs and the most freedom. Have you ever found a shortcut that others missed? Seen a new way to resolve a conflict? Made a connection with someone others couldn't reach? Even once? Then you have what it takes to become indispensable, by overcoming the resistance that holds people back. Linchpin will show you how to join the likes of... *Keith Johnson, who scours flea markets across the country to fill Anthropologie stores with unique pieces. *Marissa Mayer, who keeps Google focused on the things that really matter. *Jason Zimdars, a graphic designer who got his dream job at 37signals without a résumé. *David, who works at Dean and Deluca coffeeshop in New York. He sees every customer interaction as a chance to give a gift and is cherished in return. As Godin writes, ""Every day I meet people who have so much to give but have been bullied enough or frightened enough to hold it back. It's time to stop complying with the system and draw your own map. You have brilliance in you, your contribution is essential, and the art you create is precious.

, the fastest-growing comic strip in America (syndicated in more than 900 newspapers and read by more than 60 million people), presents a hilariously biting compilation of cartoons that expose the absurdities of corporate management. Dilbert is sweeping the nation. The San Francisco Chronicle dubbed him ""the cartoon hero of the workplace,"" saying that the strip ""has its finger on the pulse of the '90s white-collar workplace."" Now online, it is one of the hottest Web sites on the Internet, and more than a million copies of the Dilbert &nbsp cartoon books have been sold.
In this latest cartoon compilation, Dilbert's canine sidekick, the Machiavellian Dogbert, presents a breakthrough management manual to help bosses stick it to their employees. All too often, new managers make mistakes like rewarding good work with good pay, communicating clearly and improving departmental efficiency. Dogbert shows that this could have devastating results: Employees begin to expect fair treatment and compensation, productive workers show results (making the managers look bad by comparison) and the department's future budget allotment could be decreased because it spends only what it needs.
Drawn from years of experience tormenting Dilbert and advising his boss, Dogbert's Top Secret Management Handbook uses pithy essays, whose points are illustrated with hundreds of comic strips, to drive home the lost cause of the employee in the workplace.

When you become a manager, it's your job to say it - and your obligation. Author Kim Scott was an executive at Google and then at Apple, where she developed a class on how to be a good boss. She has earned growing fame in recent years with her vital new approach to effective management, Radical Candor
. Radical Candor is a simple idea: to be a good boss, you have to Care Personally at the same time that you Challenge Directly. When you challenge without caring its obnoxious aggression; when you care without challenging its ruinous empathy. When you do neither its manipulative insincerity. This simple framework can help you build better relationships at work, and fulfill your three key responsibilities as a leader: creating a culture of feedback (praise and criticism), building a cohesive team, and achieving results you're all proud of. Radical Candor offers a guide to those bewildered or exhausted by management, written for bosses and those who manage bosses. Taken from years of the author's experience, and distilled clearly giving actionable lessons to the listener; it shows managers how to be successful while retaining their humanity, finding meaning in their job, and creating an environment where people both love their work and their colleagues.

I am happy to share with you my personal experience with this company so that it may encourage you to “go for it” . . . both by making your own dream come true and by going out and purchasing a Nilo brand table and/or product!
As many companies are . . . it all started out of my garage in 1992. My wife and I didn’t find a suitable multi-use table for our two children, 2 and 4 years of age. So the wife says, “why don’t you make us a table, honey?” I did. As per my wife’s instructions, I increased its size to fit the Lego/Duplo base plates (LEGO Compatible, not made by LEGOs). Then, holes around the border of the table were added to accommodate Brio-Mec, a fun construction toy at the time. Bingo, the Nilo table was born. Shortly after its arrival, our friends started flocking over to our house to see this “table” in action. They couldn’t believe it. . . our kids and theirs were playing quietly around this multi-functional table. They watched as the children played in total peace and how our house stayed in order.

As many companies are . . . it all started out of my garage in 1992. My wife and I didn’t find a suitable multi-use table for our two children, 2 and 4 years of age. So the wife says, “why don’t you make us a table, honey?” I did. As per my wife’s instructions, I increased its size to fit the Lego/Duplo base plates (LEGO Compatible, not made by LEGOs). Then, holes around the border of the table were added to accommodate Brio-Mec, a fun construction toy at the time. Bingo, the Nilo table was born. Shortly after its arrival, our friends started flocking over to our house to see this “table” in action. They couldn’t believe it. . . our kids and theirs were playing quietly around this multi-functional table. They watched as the children played in total peace and how our house stayed in order.

In fact, it is fairly common among Deep Space Miners (5th class), and some say that it is almost unavoidable. And, well, it is. Especially since the crystals that you seek happen to be inside giant space beasts. To mine them, you need to, well, be eaten. But, no reason to panic. We are here to help you deal with the physical and mental challenges of being eaten. This handy simulation/survival guide is standard issue for all recruits and will eventually lead to a productive, if not potentially brief, career in space mining. Should you achieve your objective and mine enough crystals to meet your quota, it is then cost-effective for the company to activate your jet pack and extricate you from the proverbial belly of the beast. While the beast’s immune response was not enough to prevent its demise, its contribution to human progress and corporate profitability are most definitely appreciated. In the eventuality that the bacteria present in the beast overwhelm you and you are digested, do not worry. Your non-organic parts will ultimately provide much utility to future space miners. In fact, you may encounter some such pieces of equipment in your expedition, remains of attempts by evidently less-than-qualified recruits. Finally, it could transpire that you do not collect the necessary crystals by the time you reach the end of the beast's digestive tract. In this case, the so-called ""ending #2"", you will then exit the beast from the other end than the one you entered. Alive, and yet forever changed. In this case, and after a thorough decontamination and quarantine period, we will have to evaluate your performance versus that of the beast’s efforts to consume you.

Henry’s daughter, Empress Matilda, believed she should rule by succession. However, the late king’s favorite nephew, Stephen de Blois, was quicker to the throne, and with the help of his brother, the Bishop of Winchester, was crowned king. Those loyal to the empress were enraged by Stephen’s coronation and would not accept him as their new ruler. Over the next 18 years, England saw a breakdown in law and order as civil war spread throughout the country. This conflict came to be known as The Anarchy.

Unable to talk, the amnesic ghost will communicate with the mediums through visions (illustrated cards).

This is a story of a time dilation event alteration artifact that becomes a direct proxy and descendant of Our Lord and Heavenly Father
. It explores an observation event surrounding the quantum conceptional Box of Santa’s Manifestation
, aligning with a time dilation artifact that plays a pivotal role in the ascension of ABBA
.
At its heart, the story is about a boy named Tony Anderson
, who discovers an Angelic/Alien artifact left on a hill by early pioneers. These pioneers, entrusted with safeguarding Two Stones and the Alignment Tool (RUSTY) on the Red Hill of Southern Utah
, scattered the objects to avoid their confiscation by a US Army Battalion under presidential orders. At the age of 8, Tony stumbles upon the Alignment Tool while searching for polished rocks left by an old lady. This artifact, believed to be a remnant of a sophisticated machine’s dashboard, bonds with Tony after he makes contact, inadvertently touching a head injury sustained earlier that day.
This quantumly aligned artifact

This new look at the hobby searches for the historical origins of role-playing games deep in the imaginative worlds of Western culture. It looks at the earliest fantasy stories from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, at the fans--both readers and writers--who wanted to bring them to life, at the Midwestern landscape and the middle-class households that were the hobby's birthplace, and at the struggle to find meaning and identity amidst cultural conflicts that drove many people into these communities of play. This book also addresses race, religion, gender, fandom, and the place these games have within American capitalism. All the paths of this journey are connected by the very quality that has made fantasy role-playing so powerful: it binds the limitless imagination into a ""strict"" framework of rules. Far from being an accidental offshoot of marginalized fan communities, role-playing games' ability to hold contradictions in dynamic, creative tension made them a necessary and central product of the twentieth century.",0.0,0.0,0,0,B0F1L9CY6D,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81HHVdozSyL._SL1500_.jpg

Players build bases, recruit troops, embody gods, explore the territory, develop their own technology, sign trade contracts, defeat local dominions and other players’ armies, trying to conquer Atlantis, which owns huge treasures. Different actions will provide a certain number of immediate Victory Points. Moreover, random setup goals will provide you with sizable Victory Point rewards at the end of the game, based on specific conditions. In the end, the player with the most VPs will be the winner. In addition to having a strong dose of controllability (the luck factor is minimal), the game features an innovative starred action-selection-system that confronts players with interesting choices: players can reincarnate their gods by performing their actions in a precise sequence, on pre-established paths of their starred player board, or they can give up some deities, jumping freely from one action to another of their board, to choose the best actions on each turn. a 4x eurogame by Simone Luciani and Danilo Sabia.",0.0,0.0,0,0,B07NHV1VXR,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61A1TEwNL7S._AC_SL1500_.jpg

Players can gather loot, battle both undead and human foes, maintain settlements, and even care for pets, all in an effort to survive and preserve their sanity. The world is a place of nightmarish violence and grim realities, and you will need all the help you can get.
Journey is an easy-to-pick-up, adaptable, story-driven experience with a streamlined combat system supported by unique loot cards. Focus on the events in the story and the choices made by the players, rather than being bogged down by complicated rulebooks. The Apocalypse is at your fingertips…

Why do fiction authors outline the rules of a game that the audience will never play? Combining perspectives from philosophy, literary theory and game studies, this book provides the first in-depth investigation into the significance of fictional games within fictional worlds. Drawing from contemporary cinema and literature, from The Hunger Games to the science fiction of Iain M. Banks, Stefano Gualeni and Riccardo Fassone introduce five key functions that different types of imaginary games have in worldbuilding. First, fictional games can emphasize the dominant values and ideologies of the fictional society they belong to. Second, some imaginary games function in fictional worlds as critical, utopian tools, inspiring shifts in the thinking and political orientation of the fictional characters. Third, a few fictional games are conducive to the transcendence of a particular form of being, such as the overcoming of human corporeality. Fourth, imaginary games within works of fiction can deceptively blur the boundaries between the contingency of play and the irrevocable seriousness of “real life”, either camouflaging life as a game or disguising a game as something with more permanent consequences. And fifth, they can function as meta-reflexive tools, suggesting critical and/or satirical perspectives on how actual games are designed, played, sold, manipulated, experienced, understood and utilized as part of our culture. With illustrations in every chapter bringing the imaginary games to life, Gualeni and Fassone creatively inspire us to consider fictional games anew: not as moments of playful reprieve in a storyline, but as significant and multi-layered expressive devices.",0.0,0.0,0,0,B0CVDRWS3L,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Odqd8W7wL._SL1024_.jpg

, you will:
- Learn the main lines of the Italian Game for White.
- Optimize your winning chances based on a formal statistical analysis of game outcomes.
What is Blitz Theory? Blitz Theory is a groundbreaking new approach to chess openings based on a massive statistical analysis of online blitz games. The database includes over 20 million games played on Lichess with an average rating of approximately 2500 (top 0.1% of blitz players). To generate the 40 variations that comprise the repertoire, we crowdsourced the moves most frequently chosen by top players. We then conducted formal statistical tests in each and every position -- based on real game outcomes -- to determine whether an alternative move is an improvement over the main line.
The book is accessible to chess players of all skill levels. To play through the moves, simply turn the page to update the chess board diagram. Variations are ordered based on opponent move frequency, so the variations you learn first are the ones you're most likely to encounter. For those wanting to go deeper, we include a dynamic data visualization that updates with new information as the variation unfolds. We additionally provide ranked lists of the most extreme statistical findings, including:
- The top 30 repertoire improvements;
- The top 30 suboptimal opponent moves; and
- The top 30 opponent improvements.
The Blitz Theory algorithm is completely automated. It takes a chess position and outputs a repertoire. Visit www.blitztheory.com to check out other repertoires and sign up for our monthly newsletter.

Gordon Calleja examines key aspects of board game experience—the nature of play, attention, rules, sociality, imagination, narrative, materiality, and immersion—to offer a theory of board game experience and a model for understanding game involvement that is relevant to the analysis, criticism, and design of board games. Drawing on interviews with 32 leading board game designers and critics, Calleja—himself a board game designer—provides the set of conceptual tools that board game design has thus far lacked. After considering different conceptions of play, Calleja discusses the nature and role of attention and goes on to outline the key forms of involvement that make up the board game playing experience. In subsequent chapters, Calleja explores each of these forms of involvement, considering both the experience itself and the design considerations that bring it into being. Calleja brings this analysis together in a chapter that maps how these forms of involvement come together in the moment of gameplay, and how their combination shapes the flow of player affect. By tracing the processes by which players experience these moments of rule-mediated, imagination-fueled sociality, Calleja helps us understand the richness of the gameplay experience packed into the humble board game box.",0.0,0.0,0,0,0262543958,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81TMa4yOXBL._SL1500_.jpg

Board games harness the creation of entirely new worlds. From the medieval warlord to the modern urban planner, players are permitted to inhabit a staggering variety of roles and are prompted to incorporate preexisting notions of placemaking into their decisions. To what extent do board games represent the social context of their production? How might they reinforce or subvert normative ideas of community and fulfillment? In Playing Place
,
Chad Randl and D. Medina Lasansky have curated a collection of thirty-seven fascinating essays, supplemented by a rich trove of photo illustrations, that unpack these questions with breadth and care.
Although board games are often recreational objects, their mythologies and infrastructure do not exist in a vacuum—rather, they echo and reproduce prevalent cultural landscapes. This thesis forms the throughline of pieces reflecting on subjects as diverse as the rigidly gendered fantasies of classic mass-market games; the imperial convictions embedded in games that position player-protagonists as conquerors establishing dominion over their “discoveries”; and even the uncanny prescience of games that have players responding to a global pandemic. Representing a thrilling convergence of historiography, architectural history, and media studies scholarship, Playing Place suggests not only that tabletop games should be taken seriously but also that the medium itself is uniquely capable of facilitating our critical consideration of structures that are often taken for granted.",0.0,0.0,0,0,0262047837,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81Indw5IeWL._SL1500_.jpg

Lone Sherman puts you in charge of a single Sherman Tank and its crew somewhere in France in World War II, and tasks you with navigating your Sherman through varied and challenging Missions. Whilst this game is not a ‘narrative driven’ game as such, with a little imagination it will provide memorable stories. The Missions allow the Player to invent any kind of back-story they like in order to enhance the feel of the game. Some events are randomly generated, but the Player always has at least some degree of control over the level of risk they wish to take and how vulnerable they leave their Tank to these Events.
The aim of this book is to present a clear, accessible, and quick to learn game, so that players can get into the action quickly. It does not try to replace more complex wargames which often take many hours to learn and to play. Each of the 11 Missions can be played in around an hour, although sometimes a Mission will last a much shorter time if your Tank is destroyed! Each Mission provides plenty of replayability due to the random set up of the initial forces and the many Events and decisions in the game.
This book is a solitaire hex and counter style wargame. You play the game, and the enemy is controlled by the game book (or the Artificial Intelligence or ‘AI’). You will need to bring at least 5, but preferably 7, standard six-sided dice. Full colour 'Mission Maps' are included.

Battles of Medieval Britain covers battles fought between the year 937 and 1403. By modern standards, the forces on each side were small in size, but battles were fierce and bloody and were no place for the faint-hearted. In many cases the exact details of the battle have never been fully established, including what weapons were used, the scale of the armies on each side, and even exactly where the battles took place. The battles in this book are only meant to be loose representations of the actual battles they depict, and in some cases deliberate changes or additions have been made to add to the play experience. But they will provide some idea of what happened at each Battle, and allow the Player to try to reproduce, or recreate, history.
In the game, the Player will be commanding various units, often representing many hundreds of men each, seeking to achieve various Objectives. Key battles from different years are included, although all fall into what is generally referred to as the medieval period. The Player will control various different armies and units depending on the battle.
The aim of this book is to present a clear, accessible, and quick to learn game, so that players can get into the action quickly. It does not try to replace more complex wargames which often take many hours to learn and to play. It also does not pretend to be entirely realistic, and many concepts have been simplified for gameplay purposes – it is not a simulation. Each Battle can be played in around 20 to 30 minutes, and each one should provide plenty of replayability due to the random set up of the initial forces and composition and location of reinforcements.
This book is a solitaire wargame. You play the game, and the book will provide the “enemy”. You will need at least 4, but preferably 6, standard six-sided dice.

Versions of the game have been found in Egypt, Sudan, Crete, Cyprus, and even in India. Similar to the Royal Game of Ur, Aseb probably arrived in Egypt from ancient Sumer during the 17th Dynasty. Aseb is a race game, but also a running-fight game in which players gradually eliminate their opponent’s pieces as they conduct the race. Using stick dice and moving on a race track with a few “safe” spaces, the game is somewhat random, but some tactical decisions add to the fun. A player wins by either getting all their pieces off the board or eliminating the opponent from the board. Made in USA for 2 players age 12+.

. Command an American B-17 Flying Fortress bomber during the 1942-44 bombing campaigns of World War II.
Your B-17 missions will take you to various locations in Europe during the war, from the skies of France to the heart of Germany. Your plane and crew will face bad weather, chance circumstances, Axis air defenses, and fighter planes determined to stop your bombing missions. The Axis forces are an autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) BOT player. The goal is to earn victory points from successful bombing runs and downed enemy fighters, all while keeping your crew safe.
The Axis forces have stacked the deck against you. Still, success and survival can be achieved with careful planning, good flying, and keeping the target in sight. Good luck!
To play the B-17 Solitaire Bookgame, you will need to provide a pen and at least one six sided die, we recommend two. Each set of Map and Plane pages have 3 different missions, with 30 unique missions in total. There are two chances to play each mission, in Book 1 and Book 2 which provides a total of 60 missions. A dice rolling smart phone application can be used in place of the dice.
A quick example of the exciting gameplay:
Mission 1: Rail Yards at Rouen, France
Your first bombing mission in Europe should be an easy milk run. Let’s show them what we got.
Starting in the south of England with a clear weather report, you take off and rendezvous with your squadron. Moving south, you are in the lead formation. You tick off squares on the map, noting your remaining fuel each turn. As you enter enemy air space in turn 2, you encounter fighter resistance. Rolling one die, you roll a 4, easily avoiding any fighter engagement.
As you continue to fly, they come at you again. Rolling a 2 brings the fighters to your doorstep. As you roll again, a 5, Fighters High. The top turret springs into action. Shells rain down into the cockpit as you roll for your gunner action. Another 5. Engine 3, just outside your co-pilot’s window, starts to spew oil, and then the top gunner screams out, “I’m Hit!”
Next, moving further south, noting your fuel consumption again, flak appears on the horizon. When flak is encountered, you roll a 2! Heavy flak begins to burst all around you. You roll a die again to see where it hits and get a 6. Both engines 1 and 2 are aflame, and one damage is marked on each engine.
As the flak subsides, the infamous German Luftwaffe Messerschmitt 109s are spotted. “Fighters incoming,” your top gunner yells across the radio. Rolling a die, you roll a 2... they have found your fort. Rolling again to plot their direction, you get a 4. “Fighters, 9 o’clock!” your waist gunner calls as he squeezes off a few fiery bursts from his 50-caliber machine gun.
Rolling a die again, it’s a 1! A stream of smoke and fire fills the sky as the 109 is no more. There is no time to celebrate, though; you still need to make it across the coast and into France to give one of Hitler’s railyards its final stop.
Turning east into the next square, both flak and fighters are avoided by rolling a 5 and 6. With your eyes locked on the target, you advance into the next square. As you fly into the target square, flak fills the sky. Rolling a 2, the flak jars your plane and with a damage roll of 3, the rudder is hit. Fighters appear, but with a roll of 6, they miss you.
As you prepare your bombing run, you plan to come in at a low altitude. Passing the controls to the Bombardier, he carefully lines up the target in the bombsight and waits for the perfect shot.” Bombs away,” he shouts as he turns off the auto-pilot, and you take back the controls. Rolling a 5, modified to a 4 for the low altitude, gains you a hit and scores you 4 VP. He did great.

,
or run the guns of Vicksburg!
The clash of the ironclad gunships CSS Virginia and USS Monitor at the Battle of Hampton Roads on March 9, 1862 heralded a new age of naval warfare. The steam-powered engines introduced earlier in the century had already revolutionized the mobility of nineteenth-century ships, freeing vessels of their reliance on the caprice of winds, or the dictates of river flows. The innovations begun by the industrial revolution yielded powerful new warships, armed with strong new guns, and plated with thick armor. A new ironclad navy threatened to revolutionize the practice of naval warfare, rendering the old wooden fleet obsolete.
This solitaire game explores the use of ironclads during the American Civil War through a series of scripted scenarios that teach the system gradually. Scenarios take 15 to 30 minutes to play. Each consists of a historical introduction, a playsheet (left), and a mapsheet (right).

This is not a child’s toy. Hill of Doves is a solitaire boardgame in which the player controls An Imperial British Army at war with a programmed non-player Transvaal Republican Army in 1881. The British army’s aim is to win the war by controlling the area known as Laing’s Nek which lies on the border between Natal and the Transvaal. The British army has up to twelve weeks to achieve this, failing which, the Boers will win the war. Hill of Doves is played at a strategic, operational and tactical level simultaneously. There are three phases to the game which are detailed on the Sequence of Play Cards. The Operational Phase is the heart of the game and represents a seven-day cycle, with a Strategic Phase being referred to at the end of each Operational Phase to resolve situations occurring during the week just passed and a Tactical Phase representing a variable number of hours being referred to each time the British carry out an assault. Hill of Doves is played using a programmed system whereby the player follows the instructions on the Sequence of Play cards aided by the step marker and the Set-up Card. If any battles are to be fought the player will be referred to the Tactical Deck or the Ambush Deck to resolve the battle and then the player will be prompted to return to the Operational Deck to continue the war. Hill of Doves is played on three boards simultaneously. These are the Strategic Board, Operational Board and Tactical Board. Game information is recorded on these boards and British strategic, operational and tactical columns are maneuvered on the maps located on these boards. Once the rules have been mastered, Hill of Doves can be played solely by referring to the Sequence of Play Cards mentioned above and a game can be concluded in a single evening.",0.0,0.0,0,0,B0B3RFRN71,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61VybJN7TiL._SL1294_.jpg

15570fdf-7d8c-459f-aefa-fb34fb656063,The Fields of Normandy XL: A Solitaire Wargame (Mike Lambo Solitaire Book Games),"Due to a range of factors, many troops from the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions were scattered and struggled to come under the control of division headquarters. Many of these troops formed into small groups, organised by officers and NCOs and fought behind enemy lines for up to five days. Although mainly fighting for their own lives, these groups also helped to clear significant parts of the more organised German resistance. The Fields of Normandy XL requires you to control small groups of soldiers to clear the areas presented of that German resistance.
This game is accessible, fairly quick playing, highly replayable and fun, whilst maintaining the need for tactical thinking and decision making.
If you have played The Fields of Normandy 2
, then you will already be familiar with many of the rules for The Fields of Normandy XL
. However, there are some material differences to look out for:
Maps consist of almost twice as many hexes – 48 hexes compared to 28.
There are now 15 potential enemy positions for each mission compared to 12 and these are, to some extent, positioned randomly each time rather than being fixed.
Missions run to a maximum of 14 turns compared to 10.
Maps include a new Terrain feature – Walls (instead of fences, which had no gameplay effect). Walls do have gameplay effects.
Your US force now includes two new Units – a Lieutenant Unit and a Sniper Unit which both have their own Order charts.
The Lieutenant now calls in Artillery strikes and therefore US Rifle Squads no longer do.
US Rifle Squads can now clear Mines (or more thematically perhaps, establish a clear route through them).
There is now a stacking limit of three US Units per hex.
A German Tiger (tank) might appear!
German Snipers are now a separate unit and operate independently to Rifle Squads.
German Artillery usually has more than one possible location hex per map.
In the game, you will be controlling small groups of soldiers consisting of three Rifle Squads, a Machine Gun Team, a Bazooka Team, a Mortar Team, a Sniper Team and a Lieutenant, moving them around the hex maps and undertaking other orders to achieve the objective.
The Fields of Normandy XL is an accessible, portable, solitaire ""hex and counter"" style war game in a book.

a1eeb8a2-4df2-4e81-9d75-7279c87d06f4,D-Day Solitaire: Omaha Beach (Original Bookgames),"“Two kinds of people are staying on this beach—the dead and those who are going to die.” Colonel Taylor, 16th Infantry Regiment, 1st Infantry Division, 6 June 1944 Omaha beach was the most fiercely contested of the five Normandy invasion beaches. After the initial landings at 0631 hours, the success of the Omaha operation remained in doubt until well into D-Day. Fully half of the Allied casualties suffered on the five invasion beaches were incurred on ‘Bloody Omaha’. At noon, General Omar Bradley was contemplating abandoning Omaha and re-directing follow-on forces to Utah beach. This would have been a tremendous setback, jeopardizing the success of the entire Normandy invasion. At stake was the victory of freedom over fascism.
Now you are in command, and the decisions are yours…
D-Day: Omaha Beach Solitaire has 24 games. You take the role of Major General Leonard Gerow commanding the US Army V Corps for 12 games against an opposing German autonomous player side, referred to as the German BOT side. And you take the role of Generalleutnant Dietrich Kraiss for 12 games commanding the German 352nd Infantry Division against an American BOT side. Each opposing BOT side is rated for its skill: Challenging for 4 games, Veteran for 4 games, and Tough for 4 games.
One side (either American or German) is played by you and uses their player actions. The BOT opponent uses the solitaire actions for the other side.
A player can issue one action per game turn from their available actions. You also have the option of using a Flank Attack with a supporting flanking action to the one main action played. Your choices can cause Die Roll Modifiers (DRM) that affect attacks with results that cause unit eliminations and movement to occur.
The object of the game for the American player is to defeat the Germans by the end of the game. This is accomplished by eliminating ALL German strongpoints and ALL units from at least 2 of the 3 Towns, at the end of any turn.
The object of the game for the German player is to eliminate ALL American units in any 3 or more bluff areas, at the end of Turn 18.

Sekigahara allows you to re-contest that war as Ishida Mitsunari, defender of a child heir, or Tokugawa Ieyasu, Japan's most powerful daimyo (feudal lord). The campaign lasted only 7 weeks, during which each side improvised an army and a strategy with what forces their allies could provide. Each leader harbored deep doubts as to the loyalty of his units - for good reason. Several daimyo refused to fight; some even turned sides in the midst of battle. To conquer Japan you must do more than field an army - you must be sure it will follow you into combat. Cultivate the loyalty of your allies and deploy them only when you are confident of their allegiance. Win a battle by gaining a defection from the ranks of your opponent. Sekigahara is replete with unusual mechanics: No dice are used Cards represent loyalty and motivation. Without a matching card, an army will not enter battle. Allegiance is represented by hand size, which fluctuates each turn. Battles are a series of deployments, from hidden unit stacks, based on hidden loyalty factors. Loyalty Challenge cards create potential defection events. Sekigahara is a 3-hour block game based on the Japanese campaign waged in 1600. The 7-week war, fought along Japan's two major highways and in scattered sieges and backcountry skirmishes, elevated Tokugawa Ieyasu to Shogun and unified Japan for 265 years.",0.0,0.0,0,0,B0073KK8SY,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61pacjjPPWL._AC_SL1000_.jpg

This small force, whose strength never exceeded 3,000 white and 12,000 black soldiers (askari), was opposed by some 300,000 men (150,000 at any one time), comprising British, Indian, Rhodesian, Nigerian, Gold Coast, South African, Belgian and Portuguese troops. Led by Major-General Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck, the Schutztruppe fought within its own home territory for the first three years of the war. During the final year von Lettow-Vorbeck transferred his resistance to Portuguese East Africa and trekked south to within 60 km of Quelimane.

Based on the popular Quartermaster General system, this card-driven wargame reflects the military, economic, and political intrigue of the time. In Quartermaster General: 1914, each power has its own unique deck of cards, with its own strengths and strategies, providing strong replayability as you try your hand at playing the different powers. Each card has two different uses: one when played, and another when prepared. On their turn, players can both play and prepare a card. They can also spend cards to draft more troops or use cards to subject their opponents to attrition. Each Power’s deck represents the resources of that player: “digging” too quickly through the deck in the early game might result in unsupported armies being swept away in the final rounds. This is worth it if a player can capture Berlin or Paris in 1915 - but if the gambit fails, you may have a tough road ahead. The game ends after 17 rounds of play, or earlier if one side has a commanding enough lead. Quartermaster General: 1914 is a must-have for all fans of the Quartermaster General series, and for anybody looking for an accessible grand-strategy game on the “Great War.”",0.0,0.0,0,0,1472860047,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/818PJTxsbtL._SL1500_.jpg

c364cd06-7db5-4eb1-8c77-1ef7ae3c9103,General Orders: World War II,"Aces of Valor Item is intended for adults, over the age of 18. This is not a child’s toy. Welcome to France! Aces of Valor is a solitaire game where you command a fighter squadron on the Western Front during World War I through a campaign of multiple missions to score as many victory points as possible to assist the war effort. You can play as the Germans, or one the Entente powers (British, French, or Americans). Each aircraft counter represents the pilot and the aircraft combined, and your squadron will have up to eight at any given time. The player chooses the campaign’s duration (8, 12 or 16 missions), and draws a card to determine the objective of each mission, which includes patrols, trench strafing, photo recon, artillery spotting, balloon busting, and bomber escort. The player’s flight moves across a gridded map that is a semi-historical representation of the Western front. Anti-aircraft fire is heaviest near the trenches but can happen anywhere over enemy territory. When combat occurs, aircraft are moved to an “Initiative Track” for up to three rounds of combat, where pilot skill, aircraft performance, and luck all come into play to determine the outcome. The player earns mission points by destroying enemy aircraft and ground targets, and also by escorting bomber and 2-seater aircraft on successful bombing, photo reconnaissance and artillery support missions. When the flight lands, mission points are converted to victory points or used to repair and replace aircraft as well as upgrade aircraft to newer, better models. The goal is to earn enough victory points to achieve a minor, major or strategic victory.",0.0,0.0,0,0,1472859863,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91bhxQIW1rL._SL1500_.jpg

Written as a textbook, Designing Wargames should appeal to board and computer game designers, board game players, and designers of serious war games for historical and military study. Phillies opens with a discussion of the basic elements combined to create strategic games, including representation, theme, style, mechanisms, voice, shape, and content. To introduce non-players to board wargames, he describes in detail the play of four classic board wargames, namely Stalingrad, 1914, Panzerblitz, and Fall of Manjukuo. A path to designing a game, stressing the central importance of iterative development and playtesting, is advanced. Several fundamental mechanisms and their variations, including the zone of control and command and control rules, are examined in detail. A case study contrasts a half-dozen games on a single historic campaign, comparing how different designers have created radically different games that represent the same historic outcomes. A paragraph by paragraph analysis of the written rules of one game is given. Issues related to luck and technology are examined. An extensive set of homework problems, many in the form of development projects, support the material in the text.

01ab1693-8ad9-400d-b5b1-b1d5964efad1,"The Hunt , Two Player Only Strategy Board Game , Historic WWII Themed Naval Battle - 25th Century Games","Tally-Ho! is an air war game book that puts you into the role of a Sector Controller during the Battle of Britain in the Summer of 1940. You direct Royal Air Force (RAF) fighter squadrons as you struggle to protect England from attack by incoming Luftwaffe raids. There are too many raiders and too few RAF aircraft, yet you have one major advantage – England’s “Chain Home” radar network.
Fifteen individual missions are included in this book-based game. Each mission relates to one of the key aerial engagements of the Battle of Britain. Most missions can be completed in less than thirty minutes. This is not a simulation of air-to-air combat between individual fighter planes, nor is it intended to be a realistic depiction of the air war. Rather, it is an entertaining educational tool that allows you to experience the story of the conflict through strategic decision-making set against a backdrop of the real history of the Battle of Britain – as if you were there.
Tally-Ho! is designed for experienced and novice war gamers alike. It is quick and easy to play yet deeply challenging. Though dice play a role, the outcome of each mission rests on your shoulders. Where you deploy your fighters, what orders you give, and what tactics you employ are the critical factors that determine the outcome of each mission. You decide which enemy aerial formations to engage and how to prioritize the Luftwaffe raids as you struggle with radio communications and the fog of war
.
Most of the time, you cannot stop the Luftwaffe. Bombs will fall. Airfields will be strafed. Convoys at sea will suffer. London will undergo the ""Blitz"". Your performance in each mission will affect the setup of subsequent missions by reducing or increasing the number of aircraft on each side. If you direct your squadrons skillfully, you might prevail and save England.
When you have completed all fifteen missions, the results are tallied to create a formal Fighter Command War Report, which you can read yourself. Based on your results, the War Cabinet and Parliament vote to fight on or surrender
.
If you failed in your mission to protect England from Luftwaffe attacks, what choice would the Parliament have but to negotiate terms with Berlin to spare the nation from invasion?
Meanwhile, in the coastal ports of France, the German Wehrmacht is preparing for Operation Seelöwe – the invasion of England. Intelligence reports indicate that Deputy Führer Rudolf Hess may be planning a personal flight in a Messerschmitt Bf 110 on a “journey of peace” to meet with the Duke of Hamilton at his home of Dungavel House, in Glasgow, Scotland. Will his flight be to accept England’s surrender or will it go down in history as the folly of a madman?

Volume one is divided into chapters devoted to race games, war games, games of position, Mancala games, dice games, and domino games; volume two follows the same arrangement and then proceeds to games with numbers, card games requiring boards, and games requiring manual dexterity. Additional information is furnished on making boards and pieces, and on gaming-counters.
Game players, toymakers, and historians of culture will welcome this guided tour of games from Egypt, Meso-America, the Orient, India, Persia, Rome, Africa, Victorian England, and many other societies. Over 300 illustrations, both photographs and line drawings, add an illuminating counterpoint to the text.",0.0,0.0,0,0,0486238555,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91ifcJp1eiL._SL1500_.jpg

Hi I'm Dan
I created the Adventure Trek board game.
I have always been passionate about all types of adventure and board games so one day I wanted to combine the two passions and create my own adventure race board game.
It started in 2008,  I came up with some prototypes but got stuck on the playability of the game....so the project got pushed to the side.
Here are some pictures of my original vision of Adventure Trek back in 2008-2009 timeframe.
Fast-forward to 2023 when one day the playability and rules came to me. (literally out of nowhere...)

Just select your favorite heroes, and get ready for an all-new campaign! The King of Keoland, after unsuccessful expansion to the north, has turned his eyes southward, to Saltmarsh, with the intention of turning this village into an important port to increase the stature of his kingdom. But not everyone in the village is happy about the new developments, and old enemies fight for control, unaware of a new enemy about to rear its ugly head. You come through the town gates and cross Sharkfin Bridge…to the screams of townsfolk and the unmistakable sounds of fighting. You do not know the situation but you are sure you are needed. Return to the classic gameplay of the D&D Adventure System, with some exciting new changes! You’ll still take on the role of a D&D hero, with thematic skills and abilities, and either on your own, or as a group of up to 5 adventurers. You’ll face multiple scenarios in an overarching campaign, evolving and leveling up your character on the way. You’ll explore treacherous dungeons, avoid deadly traps, and defeat terrifying monsters. You can also play your favorite scenarios on their own as a stand-alone experience!

You’ll add these to the miniatures from your Adventure System Games to populate the board, using included tokens to represent any monsters you may not already have.

It’s an exciting and different game mode, where without exploration, the new Adventure deck provides the challenges and surprises that stand between the Heroes and success.

If your game did not include GP tokens, you will need to track gold some other way. Otherwise, necessary components that do not appear in all games have the tokens and rules included.

Fantasy Adventure Game, Strategy Game for Kids & Adults, Ages 14+, 2-4 Players, 30-60 Min Playtime, Made by Sand Castle Games","A midnight bell tolls on the streets of Wildegrens as the villagers shutter their windows against the darkness. Something moves through the night–in the forest, through the fields, across the old battlefield. The isolated village is in danger. Crops are failing, animals are dying, and villagers are disappearing. Townsfolk are scared. Some of the women are fighting back, but the villagers suspect that these women may be dealing with the devil himself. From behind the old school a shadow crosses to the town well. A feeble light reveals two witches who nod to one another, shutter the lantern, and make their way towards the dark woods. Witchcraft! is a fast-playing, card-driven solitaire game where you lead a coven of witches in a fantasy world where magic is real–and so are the monsters. Building on the hidden / revealed mechanism of Resist! you will decide when to use magic to defeat the challenges you face–revealing yourself to your fellow villagers and being imprisoned for witchcraft. As you complete missions and defeat enemies you will try to prove to the villagers that magic is not evil, and convince a jury that you are protecting the village. Three jurors will decide your fate and their conviction is strong. Can you persuade them? Or will evil overcome you and the village? At the beginning of the game you assemble a coven of witches from families of women represented by a deck of cards. Selecting multiple witches from a family makes that family more powerful. Each family is focused on different tasks in the game–revealing challenges, increasing attack power, uncovering the conviction of the jurors, or capturing familiars to help you in your fight. The fight is real and each of the eight jurors face a different villain. Is it the Headless Horseman, Baba Yaga, the Scarecrow, or some other fiend? On setup you choose three jurors, their missions, and their unique challenges–providing 56 possible combinations with great variety in the types of challenges and monsters you will face. If you fail two missions or lose five villagers, you lose the game. Even if you defeat the missions you still face the trial, and you are only sure of your fate when you reveal the conviction of the jurors and see if you have done enough to persuade them.",0.0,0.0,0,0,B07PFRTSB2,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/913OHXqX3pL._AC_SL1500_.jpg

Players can come across treasures that are found nowhere else, but they must be careful, as the woods conceal all new types of monsters and two new bosses lurking in the dense foliage.

Players can even embark on the side mission during their regular games of Bloodborne: The Board Game by simply adding the special side mission to their campaign.במהלך היום, היער מספק חומרים לבנייה ובישול והם מקור לאוכל. אבל כאשר החשיכה נופלת, סוגים שונים של יצורים מתחילים לשוטט עליו וזה זן שונה לחלוטין של צייד אשר נע בין העצים.

This robust expansion covers the entire scope of time from founding your first Pantheon of the Gods and spreading religion across the world, to deploying your spies in enemy cities in order to steal information and technology. As you move through the ages, you'll interact with new types of city-states, engage in new city-state quests and global competitions, and master exciting new systems for land and naval combat. Civilization V: Gods and Kings will also include nine new civilizations, nine new wonders, three original scenarios, and dozens of new units, buildings, and techs that will offer even more ways for players to expand their empire and dominate the world. Amazon.com Sid Meier's Civilization V: Gods and Kings is the first official expansion pack for the Turn-Based Strategy game, Sid Meier's Civilization V .* It features the introduction of religion as a major gameplay component to the game, through a faith-based mechanism. It also adds additional diplomatic abilities to those found in the base game. Additional features include, a variety of benefit types for the establishment and adoption of religion, spies that both level with mission completion and that can be a liability if captured, several new playable civilizations, improved battle abilities, and new units, buildings and wonders. Expanded Power with Religion and Enhanced Diplomacy The Sid Meier's Civilization V: Gods and Kings expansion pack* introduces the power of religion and improved diplomatic abilities to Civilization V . Religion, used as a major tool, was left out of the 2010 base game release, but now joins culture, technology, diplomacy, and warfare as the fifth pillar of the game's turn-based statecraft and empire building game mechanic. Use of religion begins during a civilization's infantcy, with the player interweaving select core beliefs with particular realities of their civilization. This in turn unifies people and generates faith, setting the stage for the emergence of unit's like The Great Prophet, Missionaries and The Inquisitor, along with the founding of a religion. Religions available initially correlate to actual world religions such as Buddhism, Christianity, Confucianism, Hinduism, Islam, Shinto, etc., but they are designed to be renamed and customized with player chosen tenets. Civilizations that found religions enjoy certain exclusive benefits, while a later series of benefits connected to a religion can be enjoyed by any civilization that is converted to it. This includes rival civilizations. As the timeline of the game progresses to the renaissance and beyond, religion becomes less important, but remains a surprisingly powerful tool. Introduces religion to Civ V statecraft gameplay tactics. View larger Improved use of spies allows for even more in-depth strategy. View larger The Sid Meier's Civilization V: Gods and Kings expansion pack also improves on the base game's use of diplomacy, especially in the area of espionage. With spies players can do a wide range of things, including steal technologies, provide intelligence, rig elections, and even counter the actions of foreign spies planted domestically in their own cities. New Unit Battle Abilities and New Civilzations Although religion and diplomacy are potent tools of state craft, war is inevitable. This is why Sid Meier's Civilization V: Gods and Kings includes expanded abilities to units in battle. Improvements include: expanded general health of units to ensure more time for strategy and changes to forces during exchanges, the inclusion of early multi-winged aircraft, expanded offensive abilities of naval units pitted against other ships and against land tagets, and improved defensive abilities of ground units during transport by sea. Gods and Kings also includes additional civilization not included in the initial release of the base game. In many cases, following the theme of the expansion pack these new peoples possess an extreme potential for influence by/and manipulation of religion. A sampling of the new civilizations available include, the Celts lead by Boudicca, the warrior queen of the proto-British Iceni tribe, and the Maya featuring Pacal the Great the long-time ruler of the powerful city-state of Palenque.

Two-letter words are not only the basic building-blocks of Scrabble, they are the anchor-points upon which our most fantastic and high-scoring words depend. Creating words from our available tiles is only half the battle: fitting them into the existing words on the board is if anything the trickier part of the game.
The competitive Scrabble player must therefore develop a knowledge of and facility with these elusive two-letter words. There is simply no other way to take full advantage of the opportunities of the game. When you possess such an easy familiarity, your opponents will wonder how you are able to dominate the board and place your words with such apparent ease! This book gives you:
Explanatory definitions of every allowed two-letter word, including interesting background facts and/or memorable etymological notes.
A mnemonic phrase after each definition, designed to encourage prompt recall by lodging the word in your memory, connected to a well-known saying, pun or mental image.
Plural forms for all words, where applicable.
Full reference word-lists arranged by starting and ending letters, which can assist memorization by repetition.
Margin space for you to add your own phrases, drawings, etc.
Pages for your own notes - also useful for writing in any new words to be added to the list in future.
Note: Two-letter words that are present in Collins Scrabble Words but not in the NASPA Word List are marked as such, as are plurals.

It seemed like the summer would never end, but that fortune teller was right. It’s over. Autumn, the time of the harvest. Agriculture has advanced significantly in recent years, ever since the discoveryof the maxim, “leaves of three, let it be.” Autumn, a time of celebration. The peasants have spent a hard week scything hay in the fields, but tonight the festivities begin, starting with a sumptuous banquet of roast hay. Then, the annual nose-stealing competition. Then, two jesters, one who always lies, one who always tells the truth, both hilariously. Then, they fight to the death! This celebration will truly have something for everyone. GUILDS: Jobs, everyone’s worried about jobs. Whatever happened to tilling the fields in obscurity? The economy is just a trick, like stealing someone’s nose, but lately people seem to have seen through it, like when you realize someone hasn’t really stolen your nose. So now everyone’s joining a guild, learning a craft, and working on a masterpiece – a painting so beautiful it blinds you, or a cheese grater so amazing that you never eat cheese again. The only people left tilling the fields are the ones doing it ironically. The guilds cover everything – ironic tilling, butchering, baking, candlestick making, shoemaking, cheesemaking, cheese destruction. Your advisor is convinced that somehow, control of the stonecutters is key to world domination. Very well. You will have stone handled so expertly that the world trembles before you. This box combines the 5th (Cornucopia) and 8th (Guilds) Dominion expansions. Together they add 26 new Kingdom cards to Dominion. Cornucopia’s central theme is variety, while Guilds has coin tokens you can save and spend later and cards that you get more out of by paying extra for them.

It’s survival of the fittest as you compete to build the largest, most dominant pack by claiming territory, recruiting lone wolves, and hunting prey. But be careful not to expand too recklessly into terrain where your rivals thrive– they may lure members of your pack away! A clever action-selection mechanism drives your choices. Each action requires you to flip terrain tiles matching the terrain where you wish to take your action. These double-sided tiles mean the actions you take this round will set up which terrain types you can act on in the next round. As you take actions to expand your pack’s control of each region, you will also upgrade your pack’s attributes, allowing you to take more aggressive actions as the game goes on.

June, 1944. Through the D-Day landings, the Allies have seized a foothold on the beaches of Normandy. Now you must lead your troops forward as you push deeper into France and drive the German forces back. You will face intense resistance, machine gun fire, and mortar bombardment, but a great commander can turn the situation to their advantage! Undaunted: Normandy is a deck-building game that places you and your opponent in command of American or German forces, fighting through a series of missions critical to the outcome of World War II. Use your cards to seize the initiative, bolster your forces, or control your troops on the battlefield. Strong leadership can turn the tide of battle in your favour, but reckless decisions could prove catastrophic, as every casualty you take removes a card from your deck. Take charge amidst the chaos of battle, hold fast in the face of opposition, and remain undaunted. Players: 2 Ages: 14+ Playing Time: 45-60 minutes Contents: 108 cards, 18 large map tiles, dice, tokens, campaign booklet Review “ Sharp as a box of bayonets ” ―Quintin Smith, Shut Up & Sit Down “ One of the most unique games I've played in a long time. ” ―Tom Vasel, The Dice Tower “ Undaunted is a brilliantly accomplished design, offering an engrossing WWII wargame in the guise of an approachable deckbuilder. From its immersive campaign to its tight and tense squad-level gameplay, it's a flying success ” ―Matt Jarvis, Tabletop Gaming Magazine “ The abstraction of infantry combat with deckbuilding is a stroke of genius, leaving a tactically and strategically rich game ” ―Matt Thrower, There Will Be Games “ Undaunted: Normandy is by far the best wargame I've played in a long time... This is not just the kind of game that I love, it is the kind of game that the hobby needs! ” ― Marco Omnigamer “ I really think it's a fun, great system. There's a certain elegance to the gameplay, which is a term that is thrown around a lot but you know darn it this really works here ” ―Joel Eddy, Drive Thru Games “ For me, this is going to be one of my top games of 2019 ” ― Rolling Dice & Taking Names “ This is the perfect marriage of mechanics and theme and fun.

And why are the cool kids, the loners and the nerds all here together, skating dully in a circle?
The people watching from the sidelines are equally mismatched: the rink employees, tired of renting skates and selling hot dogs; the retired roller derby pros, bored by the lack of violence; and the town prudes, obsessed with the possibility that the teens might start enjoying themselves or even worse—dancing.
Suddenly, there is a scream. The body of Kevin Floosey, the new kid in town, has been found in the back hallway. It looks like someone strangled him with a leg warmer. Who could have done such a terrible thing to a guy who just wanted to dance… or is that really all he wanted?

It is simply the knower of all things. And while knowledge, in and of itself, is not dangerous, its application can be. The cultists that seek out yoga sothoth’s knowledge don't do so for enlightenment, but to push forward their nefarious schemes. For that, yoga sothoth must be destroyed.
