<br />
Assigned to the Serial Crimes Unit, Agent Ethan Thomas must answer this question, and bring the worst of society to justice. His solve rate is the best in the bureau....perhaps too good.<br />
<br />
While investigating the growing list of serial killers, Agent Thomas concludes that something is twisting the bodies and souls of those that society has left behind. The homeless, addicted and deranged are rising from the city’s underbelly and committing mindless acts of violence. Could there be an unseen connection between the increasing brutality of the latest serial killings and the increasing crime rate? This question is pushed to the forefront after Agent Thomas is framed for the murder of two police officers. Now he must solve the murders to stop the killings, and exonerate himself from the crimes of which he is accused.<br />
<br />
As FBI agent Ethan Thomas, you rely on sharp instincts and sophisticated forensic tools to investigate crime scenes, collect evidence, and find clues that will lead you to the killers.

These are inaccurate weapons, effective only to around 200 paces when fired in volleys. The ability to fire and reload with machine-like regularity with comrades falling all around is what wins battles; that and an ability to fight in a variety of tactical formations. Any enemy foolhardy enough to charge their cavalry at this unit while they are in square will find them a tough target. <br>					Single Player Campaign Requirements: Available when playing as the United States and holding the Barracks in Pennsylvania </td>				</tr><tr><td><div class=""bb_img_ctn""><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps_extras/10607/2.png"" /></div></td>					<td><strong>1st Maryland (United States) </strong> By their very nature, line infantry are vulnerable to bombardment from artillery and sniping from skirmishers; it takes a special kind of courage to stand and carefully fire volleys at the enemy then dispatch them with a bayonet charge. Extensive drill, training and battle have helped mould these men into soldiers, capable of dealing with the enemy on equal terms. <br>					Single Player Campaign Requirements: Available when playing as the United States and holding the Barracks in Maryland </td>				</tr><tr><td><div class=""bb_img_ctn""><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps_extras/10607/3.png"" /></div></td>					<td><strong>2nd Continental Light Dragoons (United States) </strong> When a friendly unit is being harassed by an enemy beyond its fire range, these cavalrymen can react immediately, riding to the enemy to counter the threat. When mounted they are good in melee, at the charge, and can fire their carbines. They are not very effective in close combat on foot, leaving themselves vulnerable when acting as melee infantry. <br>					Single Player Campaign Requirements: Available when playing as the United States and holding the Barracks in Confederation of New England </td>				</tr><tr><td><div class=""bb_img_ctn""><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps_extras/10607/4.png"" /></div></td>					<td><strong>2nd New York (United States) </strong> Marching or line regiments make up the majority of units in European-pattern armies. They are so-called because they form the line of battle, not because they deploy in lines. They can also form square, a particularly effective tactic against cavalry charges, although this leaves the unit incredibly vulnerable to artillery fire and skirmishers. This weakness aside, the versatility of a line regiment makes them a valuable addition to any force.<br>					Single Player Campaign Requirements: Available when playing as the United States and holding the Barracks in New York </td>				</tr><tr><td><div class=""bb_img_ctn""><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps_extras/10607/5.png"" /></div></td>					<td><strong>33rd Foot (Britain) </strong> The 33rd Foot are known as &quot;The Pattern&quot; for their stoic professionalism in battle; they are able to calmly pick targets and fire on them even while skirmishers' shots whiz by their ears, artillery shells explode around them and cavalry charges bear down upon them. To guard against such devastating enemy charges they can move from line to square formation. <br>					Single Player Campaign Requirements: Available when playing as Great Britain and holding the Barracks in England </td>				</tr><tr><td><div class=""bb_img_ctn""><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps_extras/10607/6.png"" /></div></td>					<td><strong>Brunswick Dragoons (Britain) </strong> Brunswicker dragoons are versatile troops; they have a powerful charge that can break enemy infantry formations, and can ride to critical spots on the battlefield to lend support to beleaguered allies. However, should they be pitted against infantry formed in square their charge will fall short of the power achieved by heavy cavalry units. They do have the advantage of being armed with carbine muskets, but they are trained to use these when on foot; dragoons should not be expected to engage in close combat effectively when dismounted. <br>					Single Player Campaign Requirements: Available when playing as Great Britain and holding the Barracks in England </td>				</tr><tr><td><div class=""bb_img_ctn""><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps_extras/10607/7.png"" /></div></td>					<td><strong>Hessian Grenadiers (Britain) </strong> Grenadiers see themselves as elite, and usually occupy the place of honour at the right of the line. They have every reason to be proud: only large, brave men become grenadiers. This size and strength makes them impressive and gives them an edge in melee combat. They are vulnerable when attacked by heavy cavalry and skirmish troops. This aside, grenadiers are dedicated soldiers who will follow orders to the letter. <br>					Single Player Campaign Requirements: Available when playing as Great Britain and holding a Drill School or Military Governors Barracks in North America </td>				</tr><tr><td><div class=""bb_img_ctn""><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps_extras/10607/8.png"" /></div></td>					<td><strong>King's Royal Regiment of New York (Britain) </strong> This loyalist regiment is made up of line infantrymen who fire mass volleys into the main body of an enemy to break them. Once their ammunition is spent or the enemy is sufficiently weakened, they can fix bayonets and deliver a decisive charge. Because these men fight in close formation, they are vulnerable to long-range attacks by artillery and skirmishers, but they can counter cavalry charges by moving to a square formation. <br>					Single Player Campaign Requirements: Available when playing as Great Britain and holding the Barracks in Upper Canada whilst having Improved Grenades technology </td>				</tr><tr><td><div class=""bb_img_ctn""><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps_extras/10607/9.png"" /></div></td>					<td><strong>Lee's Legion (United States) </strong> Fast moving and highly skilled, these men are truly skilled horsemen. They do not fire their carbines whilst mounted, however, preferring to ride men down and dispatch them with cold steel. These impressive collection of skills make them ideal for use against artillery and skirmishers. However, should they find themselves facing well-disciplined line infantry, formed in square, their weaknesses would swiftly become evident. <br>					Single Player Campaign Requirements: Available when playing as the United States and holding the Drill School in any American province and having the Shortened Carbine technology </td>				</tr><tr><td><div class=""bb_img_ctn""><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps_extras/10607/10.png"" /></div></td>					<td><strong>Morgan's Provisional Rifle Corp (United States) </strong> Organized as light infantry but armed with rifles rather than smoothbore muskets, riflemen have every right to see themselves as elite. Chosen for initiative and intelligence, they do not need close supervision by their officers. These crack shots are trained for ranged combat and will be found wanting if they engage in melee. At their best in cover, their loose formation makes them a tough target for line infantry, and their uniforms allow them to blend into the landscape as they stalk their human prey. <br>					Single Player Campaign Requirements: Available when playing as the United States and holding the Barracks in Virginia whilst having the Light Infantry Doctrine technology </td>				</tr><tr><td><div class=""bb_img_ctn""><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps_extras/10607/11.png"" /></div></td>					<td><strong>Pulaski's Legion (United States) </strong> These cavalrymen, armed with lances, have a devastating charge, which is especially effective against enemy line infantry. Pulaski's Legion is best employed to rush and break the enemy line, and then it should be pulled back for another charge before the enemy regains their senses. Despite their great initial attack, a wise commander will avoid leaving them in melee, as they are extremely vulnerable in prolonged close-combat. <br>					Single Player Campaign Requirements: Available when playing as the United States and holding the Barracks in Virginia </td>				</tr><tr><td><div class=""bb_img_ctn""><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps_extras/10607/12.png"" /></div></td>					<td><strong>Royal Deux-Ponts Regiment (France) </strong> Line infantry are responsible for holding the line in battle, forming the backbone of the army while specialist troops harass and chip away at the enemy. Once the enemy is worn down, the regiment can rush them with a finishing bayonet charge. Their close formation gives them strength when attacking, but leaves them vulnerable to artillery and harassing skirmishers. If under threat from cavalry they can form a defensive square. <br>					Single Player Campaign Requirements: Available when playing as France and holding the Barracks in Alsace-Lorraine whilst having the New Model Bayonet Drill technology </td>				</tr><tr><td><div class=""bb_img_ctn""><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps_extras/10607/13.png"" /></div></td>					<td><strong>Royal Welch Fusiliers (Britain) </strong> Armed with grenades and a powerful throwing arm, the Royal Welch Fusiliers are far more than your average missile troop. Their skills extend past the throwing of highly explosive projectiles, also encompassing the fine art of marksmanship, muskets being the weapon of choice. Although primarily expected to fight at range, fusiliers are also more than capable in melee and on the charge. Their only real weakness is artillery and heavy cavalry who could charge them from the flank or the rear. <br>					Single Player Campaign Requirements: Available when playing as Great Britain and holding the Barracks in England whilst having the Cadenced Marching technology </td>				</tr><tr><td><div class=""bb_img_ctn""><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps_extras/10607/14.png"" /></div></td>					<td><strong>Company of Select Marksmen/Fraser's Rangers (Britain) </strong> Rangers are used for scouting and raiding missions far beyond the skills of ordinary men. Their ranks are mostly drawn from frontiersmen already hardened to living in the wilderness and capable of hiding in a variety of terrain types. Excellent marksmen, they excel at ranged combat but suffer in prolonged melee attacks. They are trained to conceal themselves and fight in loose formation, but if caught in the open by line infantry or cavalry they are likely to sustain heavy casualties. <br>					Single Player Campaign Requirements: Available when playing as Great Britain and holding the Barracks in Upper Canada </td>				</tr><tr><td><div class=""bb_img_ctn""><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps_extras/10607/15.png"" /></div></td>					<td><strong>Tarleton's Light Dragoons (Britain) </strong> Named for Banastre Tarleton, also known as &quot;The Bloody Ban&quot;, these troops are ideal for countering enemies such as skirmishers and artillery. Tarleton's dragoons have fast horses and can quickly reach enemies out of range of friendly line units. Upon reaching their target, they can unleash a cavalry charge or engage in melee. Dismounted, they can use their carbines to fire upon the enemy, although they are relatively vulnerable in close-combat. <br>					Single Player Campaign Requirements: Available when playing as Great Britain whilst holding a Military Governors Barracks in New York whilst having the Shortened Carbines technology </td>				</tr></table>","CREATIVE ASSEMBLY, Feral Interactive (Mac), Feral Interactive (Linux)","SEGA, Feral Interactive (Mac), Feral Interactive (Linux)",$24.99,Strategy,"Single-player, Multi-player, Downloadable Content, Family Sharing","Dec 7, 2009","{'windows': True, 'mac': True, 'linux': True}",,107.0

Playing as the British Empire, you'll take on the American Army in the pivotal &quot;Battle of Brandywine Creek&quot; and then the French Navy in the decisive &quot;Battle of Lagos.&quot;<br>  <br>					<strong>Battle of Brandywine Creek</strong>   <br>					After landing from his transport ships on the American coast, Major-General Sir William Howe led the British troops eastwards, with the intention of capturing Philadelphia.   <br>					In preparation, American General George Washington readied most of his units to defend from this frontal assault around the narrow crossing of Chad's Ford on the Brandywine. The Creek flows through the countryside of Pennsylvania, enveloped by sheer cliffs and heavily wooded hills on both sides. Knowing that much of the fast-flowing creek could not be crossed, Washington was confident of holding his position.   <br>					However, more detailed surveillance of the terrain would suggest that alternative routes could turn the battle in the favor of the British.   <br>					<strong>Battle of Lagos</strong>   <br>					As so often in 18th Century warfare, French plans to invade England during the Seven Years War were reliant on ships from the naval base at Toulon joining ships from Brest. The British had both ports blockaded, and the French had to wait for one of the blockading fleets to withdraw for re-supply before attempting any rendezvous.   <br>					The opportunity came when the British fleet under Admiral Boscawen at Toulon withdrew to Gibraltar. The French under Jean-François de la Clue-Sabran left Toulon, and began to make their way towards Brest. Passing the Straits of Gibraltar, the French were spotted by Boscawen's lookout ships.   <br>					Giving chase, Boscawen's fleet was only slightly larger than the French force, and caught up with them off the coast of Portugal where battle was joined.   <br>					Take control of the British and defeat the French to end the invasion threat to Britain.     <br>					Note: This demo is presented in English language only.

<br />
Delivering on the franchise's compelling story, unrivaled authenticity and intense squad-based action, Brothers in Arms Hell's Highway drops you into Operation Market Garden, the largest paratrooper operation in World War II.<br />
<br />
Brothers in Arms Hell's Highway — next generation: The classic authentic, squad-based combat series explodes on next-generation hardware, offering unprecedented graphics and features.<br />
New story, new setting: Join Matt Baker, Joe Hartsock and the rest of the 101st Airborne Division in Operation Market Garden as they fight to open the infamous Hell's Highway in a daring bid for a quick end to the war.<br />
Live the life of an enlisted man: Get orders from HQ, go on patrol, spot the enemy and set up a devastating ambush. For the first time, finding the enemy before they find you is part of the challenge.<br />
Unprecedented character design: Lifelike characters look, talk, move and think with incredible realism. Game characters interact with the player and each other like true brothers in arms, trading ammunition, helping wounded allies and civilians, working together to man team-operated weapons, and more.<br />
Rich cinematic experience: As the squad leader, you interact with and get to know your brothers. Each character has his own distinct personality, unique story and background, and grows throughout the game.<br />
Powerful new units under your command: Players can use or command combined arms teams — machine gun crews create intense fire, bazooka crews destroy buildings and tanks, and mortar crews pound the enemy from a distance.<br />
Play your own way: Players can choose to use their squad to execute a tactically elegant flanking maneuver or charge in with guns blazing.<br />
Destructible cover: Keep your men moving and choose your cover wisely — modeled using real physical properties and behaviors, weapons will damage, dent, scorch and destroy the world around you.<br />
Completely new multiplayer experience: Fight major multiplayer battles with dozens of players on each side, combining all the intensity and accessibility of Deathmatch with the squad-based gameplay that helped make Brothers In Arms famous.",Gearbox Software,Ubisoft,$9.99,Action,"Single-player, Family Sharing","Oct 8, 2008","{'windows': True, 'mac': False, 'linux': False}",79.0,2105.0

Additionally, there are even more new units and buildings included in the three new Scenarios for modders to use.<br></li><li><strong>New Civilizations:</strong> The expansion will deliver 9 new civilizations, such as Carthage, Netherlands, the Celts, and the Maya (it is 2012, after all), along with their unique traits, units and buildings. The expansion also includes 9 new leaders including William I, Prince of Orange, Boudicca and Pacal the Great.<br></li><li><strong>Religion:</strong>  A righteous people will seek out Faith to found a Pantheon of the Gods. As your Faith becomes stronger, you can cultivate Great Prophets who build on these simple beliefs to create a religion that you can customize and enhance as desired. Are you tolerant of other religions or is this the one true faith? Are you focused on Gold, Arts or Military? Beliefs can even unlock custom buildings that only people of your religion can construct. Great prophets, missionaries and inquisitors help you spread your beliefs to other lands and gain the alliances of City States, and like-minded civilizations. <br></li><li><strong>Enhanced Diplomacy and Espionage:</strong> Establish embassies at foreign courts for closer ties (or clandestine operations). As the religions of the world start settling in, and the world moves into the Renaissance, you unlock your first spy (with more to come). Send them out to establish surveillance of foreign cities, steal advanced technologies from your strongest or wisest competitors, or interfere with city-state alliances. All of your actions can have a diplomatic impact if discovered, so always tread carefully.<br></li><li><strong>City-States:</strong> Two new city-state types have been added (Mercantile and Religious) to bring all new advantages to the table. The city-state quest system has received a complete overhaul to decrease the importance of gold and add a whole range of new quests that further the narrative of the game, as well as make the diplomatic victory a more varied option. Ally with Marrakech to get access to their unique luxury resources! Vatican City and Jerusalem are holy cities that play key roles in the religious struggle.<br></li><li><strong>World Domination:</strong> The fight for world domination is now more dynamic than ever before. The Gods and Kings expansion features a reworked combat system and AI that puts more emphasis on a balanced army composition. The new system allows your lines to stand longer than they could before, so you, as a player, can make smarter tactical decisions without worrying about a single unlucky roll of the dice.<br></li><li><strong>Naval Combat:</strong> Your navy is now split into two different ship types, melee and ranged. This means that no coastal city should be considered safe, and can now fall to a surprise naval attack. Additionally, all embarked units now have Defensive Embarkation, and can stack with a naval unit for extra protection. Add to this the new Great Admiral, and the high seas have become a much more dangerous place.<br></li><li><strong>New Wonders:</strong> There will be 9 new Wonders with all new effects including Neuschwanstein, the Great Mosque of Djenne, the Terracotta Army, the Great Firewall, and the Hubble Space Telescope.<br></li><li><strong>Three new Scenarios:</strong><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li><strong>Medieval:</strong> Grow your medieval kingdom into one of the great nations of Renaissance Europe, fending off outside invasions from Mongols and Ottoman Turks and fighting the religious wars of the Crusades and Reformation!<br></li><li><strong>Fall of Rome:</strong> Play as either Eastern Rome or Western Rome trying to fend off the barbarians OR as one of the barbarians themselves. <br></li><li><strong>Empires of the Smoky Skies:</strong> Build flying airships and huge tractor-like tanks from the unique tech tree of this Victorian science-fiction scenario, and use them to spread your empire across the pre-industrial world.</li></ul></li></ul><h2 class=""bb_tag"">Note - Demo</h2>The demo is available on PC only","Firaxis Games, Aspyr (Mac), Aspyr (Linux)","2K, Aspyr (Mac), Aspyr (Linux)",$29.99,Strategy,"Single-player, Multi-player, Downloadable Content, Steam Achievements, Steam Cloud, Family Sharing","Jun 18, 2012","{'windows': True, 'mac': True, 'linux': True}",,313.0
